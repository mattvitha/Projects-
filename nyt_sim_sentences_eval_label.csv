7002, Trump is much more enthusiastic about punishing people than he is about helping them,bear,
7002," He may have promised not to cut Social Security and Medicare, or take health insurance away from the tens of millions who gained coverage under Obamacare, but in practice he seems perfectly willing to satisfy his party by destroying the safety net",bear,
7002,"On the other hand, he appears serious about his eagerness to reverse Americaâ€™s 80-year-long commitment to expanding world trade",bear,
7002, On Thursday the White House said it was considering a 20 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico; doing so wouldnâ€™t just pull the U,bear,
7002,S,neutral,
7002," out of NAFTA, it would violate all our trading agreements",bear,
7002,"Why does he want this? Because he sees international trade the way he sees everything else: as a struggle for dominance, in which you only win at somebody elseâ€™s expense",bear,
7002,His Inaugural Address made that perfectly clear: â€œFor many decades weâ€™ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry,bear,
7002,"â€ù And he sees punitive tariffs as a way to stop foreigners from selling us stuff, and thereby revive the â€œrusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape",bear,
7002,"â€ùUnfortunately, as just about any economist could tell him â€” but probably not within his three-minute attention span â€” it doesnâ€™t work that way",bear,
7002," Even if tariffs lead to a partial reversal of the long decline in manufacturing employment, they wonâ€™t add jobs on net, just shift employment around",bear,
7002," And they probably wonâ€™t even do that: Taken together, the new regimeâ€™s policies will probably lead to a faster, not slower, decline in American manufacturing",bear,
7002,"How do we know this? We can look at the underlying economic logic, and we can also look at what happened during the Reagan years, which in some ways represent a dress rehearsal for whatâ€™s coming",neutral,
7002,"Now, Iâ€™m talking about the reality of Reagan, not the Republicansâ€™ legend, which assigns all blame for the early-1980s recession to Jimmy Carter and all credit for the subsequent recovery to the sainted Ronald",neutral,
7002," In fact, that whole cycle had almost nothing to do with Reagan policies",neutral,
7002,"What Reagan did do, however, was blow up the budget deficit with military spending and tax cuts",bear,
7002," This drove up interest rates, which drew in foreign capital",bull,
7002," The inflow of capital, in turn, led to a stronger dollar, which made U",bull,
7002,S,,
7002, manufacturing uncompetitive,bear,
7002, The trade deficit soared â€” and the long-term decline in the share of manufacturing in overall employment accelerated sharply,bear,
7002,"Notably, it was under Reagan that talk of â€œdeindustrializationâ€ù and the use of the term â€œRust Beltâ€ù first became widespread",neutral,
7002,"Itâ€™s also worth pointing out that the Reagan-era manufacturing decline took place despite a significant amount of protectionism, especially a quota on Japanese car exports to America that ended up costing consumers more than $30 billion in todayâ€™s prices",bear,
7002,"Will we repeat this story? The Trump regime will clearly blow up the deficit, mainly through tax cuts for the rich",bear,
7002," (Funny, isnâ€™t it, how all the deficit scolds have gone quiet?) True, this may not boost spending very much, since the rich will save much of their windfall while the poor and the middle class will face harsh benefits cuts",bear,
7002," Still, interest rates have already risen in anticipation of the borrowing surge, and so has the dollar",bull,
7002, So we do seem to be following the Reagan playbook for shrinking manufacturing,bear,
7002,Itâ€™s true that Mr,neutral,
7002," Trump appears ready to practice a much more extreme form of protectionism than Reagan, who avoided outright violations of existing trade deals",bear,
7002, This could help some manufacturing industries,bull,
7002," But it will also drive the dollar higher, hurting others",bear,
7002,And thereâ€™s a further factor to consider: The world economy has gotten a lot more complex over the past three decades,neutral,
7002," These days, hardly anything is simply â€œmade in America,â€ù or for that matter â€œmade in Chinaâ€ù: Manufacturing is a global enterprise, in which cars, planes and so on are assembled from components produced in multiple countries",neutral,
7002,"What will happen to this enterprise if the United States takes a meat ax to the agreements that govern international trade? There will, inevitably, be huge dislocation: Some U",bear,
7002,S,neutral,
7002," factories and communities will benefit, but others will be hurt, bigly, by the loss of markets, crucial components or both",bear,
7002,"Economists talk about the â€œChina shock,â€ù the disruption of some communities by surging Chinese exports in the 2000s",bull,
7002," Well, the coming Trump shock will be at least as disruptive",bear,

7005,â€¢ How â€˜Roseanneâ€™ shines a light on the tightrope that businesses walk in the Trump era,neutral,
7005,The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street â€“ regulations and the regulators themselves,neutral,
7005," Now, with the Trump administrationâ€™s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs",bull,
7005,"Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit",bull,
7005,"The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches",bear,
7005, Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks,neutral,
7005," The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasnâ€™t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging",neutral,
7005," To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading",neutral,
7005," Banks complained about the ruleâ€™s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce",bear,
7005, The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway,bull,
7005,Here are three ways in which traders gain ground,neutral,
7005,"â€¢ Currently, a bankâ€™s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge",bear,
7005, The new Volcker rule presumes compliance,neutral,
7005, The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators,bull,
7005,"â€¢ Under the Volcker rule now, banks have to show that trading positions held for customers are in line with what those customersâ€™ might actually demand in the near term",bear,
7005, Assessing a legitimate level of demand can be difficult,bear,
7005, Customersâ€™ appetites can change quickly â€“ and the metrics used to predict demand were complex,neutral,
7005," To try and simplify this exercise, the new rule would allow banks to establish ahead of time the â€œrisk limits,â€ù or position sizes, they set for each trading desk",bull,
7005," If a bank does not exceed those limits, they would be presumed to have a position that meets customer demand",bull,
7005," Regulators on Wednesday said they would try to make sure that the banksâ€™ risk limits was in fact in line with customer demand, but the change clearly gives the initiative to the banks",bull,
7005,"â€¢ As it was written, the Volcker rule required banks to show carefully and intricately that trades classified as hedges are tied to specific positions and risks",bear,
7005, The new rule would remove the requirement that the banks provide an analysis that shows correlation between the hedging trade and the underlying asset being hedged,bull,
7005, Banks would also no longer have to show that a hedge â€œdemonstrably reduces or otherwise significantly mitigatesâ€ù a specific risk,bull,
7005, This is a big concession from the regulators,bull,
7005, The large trading losses that JPMorgan racked up during the London Whale scandal occurred in part because huge hedging trades got out of hand,bear,
7005,"In theory, as they relaxed the Volcker rule, regulators could have found simple new ways to increase the chances of compliance",bull,
7005," For instance, they could have strengthened the part of the rule that requires C",neutral,
7005,E,neutral,
7005,O,neutral,
7005,s to attest that their banks are in compliance with the Volcker rule,neutral,
7005, But no changes appear to give it more bite,bull,
7005,"Some of the regulators argue that the Volcker rule was overly prescriptive and that the changes make it more like other banking rules, which, in their opinion, they enforce effectively",bear,
7005," Indeed, on a conference call on Wednesday officials said the changes would make it easier to ensure banks comply",bull,
7005,But the rank and file regulators can be expected to follow the lead of the political appointees who lead the agencies,neutral,
7005," If those people want to give the banks a break, the changes to the Volcker rule would clear the way for such a bonanza",neutral,
7005," â€œThe proposed changes also put a lot of faith in banksâ€™ own internal risk models and put the onus on Trump-appointed regulators to vigorously police trading activities â€” a task Iâ€™m not confident they are up for,â€ù Gregg Gelzinis, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said",neutral,

7008,"Dropboxâ€™s issue is that its products for business customers are relatively new compared with those of its rival Box, which was founded before Dropbox and began focusing on business users earlier",bull,
7008, Dropbox is behind Box in attracting the most lucrative segment of the market â€” the largest companies who will pay the most to get their data online,bull,
7008,"Adding to this is the complication that Box, which has had to spend hundreds of millions of dollars building out a sales team to go after large companies, has been pummeled by investors for its persistent losses",bear,

7008," A large and costly sales team also makes a difference, Mr",neutral,
7008," Levie argued, which is why he seemed to scoff at the notion of Dropbox as a competitor",neutral,
7008," â€œWeâ€™re mostly competing with Microsoft in the enterprise, not Dropbox,â€ù he said",neutral,
7008,"Because one company is public and one is private, and because they operate so differently, it is difficult to say whether Box or Dropbox â€” not to mention Google or Microsoft â€” will ultimately run away with the enterprise cloud services business",neutral,

7016,Republican lawmakers have their own version of the facts about the impact of their replacement for the Affordable Care Act,,
7016, Here is an assessment,,
7016,A reader asked The New York Times to examine Mr,,
7016," Toomeyâ€™s claims specifically as they related to Pennsylvania, where more than 700,000 people gained insurance through the Medicaid expansion and 360,000 through the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act",,
7016,"While the Senate bill does not revoke expanded Medicaid eligibility, it does gradually reduce the federal governmentâ€™s contributions, while also capping future funding on a per-enrollee basis",,
7016," The billâ€™s changes to premium tax credits and its elimination of cost-sharing subsidies would affect all age groups, but especially older Americans",,
7016,"This would lead to 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees and seven million fewer in the individual market within the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimated",,
7016,"According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research group, Pennsylvanians would see a 72 percent increase in out-of-pocket premium costs under the new bill, compared with a national average increase of 74 percent",,
7016,Mr,,
7016," Alexanderâ€™s carefully worded statement is technically accurate, but leaves a misleading impression",,
7016,The bill places a limit on the federal governmentâ€™s share of Medicaid spending for different groups at different times,,
7016," In 2020, it pegs funding growth to the medical inflation rate for children and adults at 3",,
7016,"7 percent, and at 4",,
7016,7 percent for disabled adults and older Americans,,
7016," In 2025, growth for all groups would be tied to the Consumer Price Index",,
7016,"But Medicaid spending for adults and children under the current law is expected to grow faster, at 4",,
7016,"9 percent per year â€” a â€œsubstantialâ€ù difference in funding, the budget office said",,
7016,The budget office estimated that the bill includes tax cuts totaling $700 billion over the next decade,,
7016," People at all income levels would see some of the money, but characterizing the cuts as a boon for the middle class is misleading",,
7016,"More than $230 billion comes from repealing two taxes that apply only to individuals making over $200,000 a year",,
7016," The bill would also eliminate a tax on health insurers, amounting to a cut of $145 billion",,
7016,"Middle-class households would see an average tax cut of $280, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center",,
7016," In contrast, a household in the top 0",,
7016,"1 percent would get a cut of $250,000",,
7016," Looking at overall distribution, two-thirds of the $700 billion would line the pockets of the richest one-fifth of Americans",,
7016,"A reader asked The Times to check a graphic circulated in the White Houseâ€™s newsletter, Your 1600 Daily, stating that premiums â€œare up by 105 percentâ€ù since the A",,
7016,C,,
7016,A,,
7016,â€™s enactment,,
7016, Mr,,
7016, Trump later bemoaned a 206 percent (actually 203 percent) increase in Alaska specifically,,
7016,"The figures come from a May report from the Department of Health and Human Services that said premiums increased to $476 this year from $232 in 2013, before the health care law took full effect",,
7016," According to the report, average premiums in Alaska jumped to $1,041 from $344",,
7016,As The Times explained in a fact-check of Mr,,
7016," McConnell, the comparison is imperfect â€” and Mr",,
7016, Trump errs further by selectively choosing the second-highest increase to exaggerate the reportâ€™s findings,,
7016,Mr,,
7016, Trump compares two fundamentally different universes of plans: all the plans on the individual market in 2013 and those only on the federal exchange in 2017,,
7016," The plans are different, with Affordable Care Act plans covering more and sicker people and offering more comprehensive benefits",,
7016,"The report also does not take into account premium tax credits that most Obamacare enrollees â€” 93 percent in Alaska, according to a different Health and Human Services report â€” receive to help blunt the cost of premiums",,
7016," Subsidies in Alaska this year averaged $976 a month, so people actually paid significantly less under the current bill than they did in 2013",,
7016,An estimated 2,,
7016,"6 million people are uninsured because they live in states that did not expand Medicaid, but earn too little to qualify for premium tax credits in the Affordable Care Act markets",,
7016, Blaming the health care law for the coverage gap distorts a chain of causality,,
7016,"As written, the law provides subsidies for marketplace insurance for people with moderate annual incomes, from 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level (about $22,160 for a family of four)",,
7016," It simultaneously increases Medicaid eligibility for low-income individuals, to 138 percent of the poverty level from the previous threshold of 44 percent",,
7016,"But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the federal government could not compel states to expand their programs, with 19 states then declining to do so",,
7016," In those states, people making 44 to 100 percent of the poverty level did not qualify for Medicaid or marketplace subsidies",,
7016,â€œThe A,,
7016,C,,
7016,A,,
7016," intended to provide coverage across the income spectrum,â€ù said Rachel Garfield, a Medicaid expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation",,
7016, â€œThe only reason that gap exists is because of those state decisions,,
7016,â€ù,,
7017,"All but one of the nationâ€™s largest banks earned an unconditional passing grade from federal regulators on their annual stress tests, which measure their preparedness to weather a financial crisis",,
7017,"The one American-based institution that did not pass unconditionally was Morgan Stanley, a Wall Street bank that has been struggling to regain its footing after the financial crisis of 2008",,
7017, Regulators raised concerns over the companyâ€™s internal controls and processes,,
7017,"The Federal Reserve gave failing grades to the American subsidiaries of two European banks, Deutsche Bank and Santander, which both failed in previous years",,
7017,"The banking stress tests â€” which measure whether banks have enough capital and liquidity, management controls and other necessary safeguards to survive various worst-case situations â€” have been required of banks with more than $50 billion in assets since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which took effect in 2010",,
7017,The passing grades mean that all of the big banks â€” even Morgan Stanley â€” will be able to pay dividends and buy back stock from shareholders,,
7017,"The results, announced by the Fed on Wednesday afternoon, are the second part of the annual stress tests, which compel each institution to run a simulation of how it would bear up under various catastrophic conditions, like an abrupt rise in interest rates or unemployment, or a big crash in equity markets",,
7017," Last week, the Fed said that all the big banks would be able to make it through a recession and still maintain adequate financial buffers",,
7017,"On Wednesday, a Fed official said that even with the concerns raised, the stress test results suggest that banks would be able to withstand an event like Britainâ€™s exit from the European Union, which has rocked bank stocks over the last week",,
7017,"Since the financial crisis, banks have been required to create large capital barriers to cushion against losses from a recession or market shock",,
7017," While the financial system has not encountered any problems close to the mortgage losses of 2008, banks have been able to withstand more recent challenges like the steep drop in oil prices and the turmoil in Europe",,
7017,"While tougher capital requirements may be helping to stabilize the banks, they are hampering profitability",,
7017, The stock prices of many large banks have languished as investors question whether these companies can increase their profits substantially in such a stringent new regulatory environment,,
7017,"The stress test results announced Wednesday are no doubt a welcome relief, in particular, to Bank of America and Citigroup, which have had difficulty passing the test unconditionally in past years",,
7017, Both banks have spent tens of millions of dollars and assigned some of their top executives to the task of ensuring that they gain the Fedâ€™s approval,,
7017,"Shortly after the results were made public, Citigroup announced that it would more than triple its dividend, to 16 cents from 5 cents, and buy back as much as $8",,
7017,6 billion of stock,,
7017, Bank of America said it would increase its dividend to 7,,
7017,5 cents from 5 cents and purchase $5 billion in shares,,
7017,Even Morgan Stanley came forward to say that it planned to raise its dividend to 20 cents from 15 cents and increase its share buyback program to $3,,
7017,"5 billion for the four quarters beginning July 1, from $2",,
7017,5 billion in the previous period,,
7017,"The three banks that were called out by the Fed on Wednesday all had big enough financial buffers, the regulators said",,
7017," Rather, the criticism was with more qualitative aspects of the way the three banks operate internally",,
7017,"At Morgan Stanley, the Fed said, the problems â€œinclude shortcomings in the firmâ€™s scenario design practices, which do not adequately reflect risks and vulnerabilities specific to the firm, weaknesses in some aspects of the firmâ€™s modeling practices, and weaknesses in governance and controls around both scenario design and modeling practices",,
7017,"â€ùMorgan Stanley will be able to return money to shareholders, as planned, but it will need to improve its internal processes by the end of the year",,
7017," If the bank does not make those improvements, the Fed could halt the bankâ€™s payouts",,
7017,"The results are an unhappy hiccup for Morgan Stanley, which has been struggling to raise its profits to the level of its competitorsâ€™ and is in the middle of a significant cost-cutting campaign",,
7017,"In a statement, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P",,
7017," Gorman, said, â€œWe are committed to addressing the Fedâ€™s concerns about our capital planning process and fully expect to meet their requirements within the established time frame",,
7017,"â€ùFor Deutsche Bank and Santander, the failing grades raise bigger concerns about their ability to satisfy American regulators",,
7017," The Deutsche Bank unit in the United States has failed twice in a row, and Santander three times",,
7017,"In this and previous years, the Fed has applied its tests only to parts of Santander and Deutsche Bank",,
7017," These two banks, as well as other foreign banks, like Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse, have large operations in the United States that have not undergone stress tests",,
7017, But that will soon change,,
7017, The large foreign banks now have to organize their American operations into a single â€œintermediate holding company,,
7017,"â€ùNext year, the Fed will do a trial test of these entities and keep the results private",,
7017," But in 2018, these large holding companies will be subjected to full-fledged tests, and the results will be made public",,
7017, Failing those stress tests would be much more of a blow to Deutsche Bank and Santander than the hit they took on Wednesday,,
7017,A Fed official said on Wednesday that all the big banks had been making progress but that Deutsche Bank and Santander still needed to make significant improvements,,
7017,"In a statement, Scott Powell, the chief executive of Santander Holdings USA, said, â€œWe are financially sound",,
7017, These results do not affect our ability to serve our customers,,
7017,"â€ùDeutsche Bank also emphasized that even though its American unit had failed the test, it still had adequate capital",,
7017,"â€œWe appreciate the Federal Reserveâ€™s recognition of our progress, and we will implement the lessons learned this year in order to strengthen our capital planning process,â€ù Bill Woodley, deputy chief executive of Deutsche Bank Americas said in a statement",,

7020,LOS ANGELES â€” Maybe there is a method to studio madness?Steven Soderbergh has long believed that the big movie studios overspend on marketing and rely too heavily on focus-group testing of trailers and other advertising materials,,
7020," And he set out to prove it with â€œLogan Lucky,â€ù which arrived in wide theatrical release on Friday",,
7020," Through an unusual arrangement, Mr",,
7020," Soderbergh had complete creative control over the filmâ€™s marketing campaign, which cost roughly $20 million â€” or half of what a studio would typically spend",,
7020,"The results were not promising: â€œLogan Lucky,â€ù a heist comedy directed by Mr",,
7020," Soderbergh, arrived to about $8",,
7020,"1 million in ticket sales, a weak showing for a well-reviewed film starring the likes of Channing Tatum and released in 3,031 theaters in North America",,
7020,"In an email on Sunday morning, Mr",,
7020," Soderbergh called the turnout â€œcertainly frustrating,â€ù but he vowed to try again with his next film",,
7020," He said that â€œUnsane,â€ù starring Claire Foy and Jay Pharoah and shot in secret in June using an iPhone, will â€œgo out with the same approach, though with some new marketing ideas we didnâ€™t get to use on â€˜Logan Lucky",,
7020,â€™ â€ùMr,,
7020, Soderberghâ€™s film arrived in third place,,
7020, The No,,
7020," 1 movie over the weekend was â€œThe Hitmanâ€™s Bodyguardâ€ù (Lionsgate), which collected a stout $21",,
7020,"6 million from 3,377 theaters, according to comScore",,
7020, Starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L,,
7020," Jackson, â€œThe Hitmanâ€™s Bodyguard,â€ù which is about exactly what the title says, received mixed-to-negative reviews",,
7020, It was independently produced for about $30 million,,
7020,Second place went to â€œAnnabelle: Creationâ€ù (Warner Bros,,
7020,"), which took in about $15",,
7020,"5 million, for a two-week domestic total of $64 million",,
7020,"â€œLogan Lucky,â€ù which Mr",,
7020," Soderbergh released through Bleecker Street Media, cost about $29 million to make and was financed by preselling foreign distribution rights",,
7020," The cast and crew worked for scale to keep the budget down, with profit participation if the film succeeds",,
7020, Mr,,
7020, Soderbergh raised the marketing funds by selling a portion of nontheatrical rights,,
7020,"â€œThis weekendâ€™s number is not a problem; we were in profit as soon as someone bought a ticket,â€ù Mr",,
7020," Soderbergh said, noting that 46 percent of total domestic ticket sales â€œwill go into a pool shared by the cast and crew",,
7020,"â€ùHe added, â€œThe entire experience has been a blast, which was also one of my goals",,
7020,"â€ùDan Fellman, a â€œLogan Luckyâ€ù producer and film distribution consultant, said by phone that turnout was strong on the coasts",,
7020," â€œWhere we didnâ€™t connect was in the South and Midwest, which is frustrating because the movie was made for that audience,â€ù he said",,
7020,"In other box office news, â€œGirls Tripâ€ù (Universal) crossed into certified blockbuster territory, taking in $3",,
7020,8 million for a five-week total of about $104 million â€” by far the best result for a live-action comedy this year,,
7020," (â€œBaywatch,â€ù with $58",,
7020,"1 million in domestic ticket sales, ranks second",,
7020,") Now the question is whether the R-rated film, about the adventures of four women at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, can perform in a similar way overseas, where comedies often get lost in translation",,
7020,"So far, Universal has only released the film in Britain and a handful of small markets, like South Africa and Trinidad, leading to some questions in Hollywood about the studioâ€™s plans",,
7020," Niels Swinkels, Universalâ€™s executive vice president for international distribution, said in an interview that â€œGirls Tripâ€ù will be released in Australia in the coming weeks and Germany in November, with more markets to follow",,
7020,"â€œWeâ€™re super encouraged by our first toe dip,â€ù Mr",,
7020," Swinkels said by phone, noting strong ticket sales in Britain and Ireland, where â€œGirls Tripâ€ù has collected $8",,
7020,9 million in 24 days of release,,
7020, â€œWeâ€™re going to take it as far as we absolutely can,,
7020," With all of our comedies, from â€˜Ride Alongâ€™ to â€˜Bridesmaids,â€™ we go slow overseas to find the optimal dates",,
7020,"â€ùMovies like â€œGirls Trip,â€ù which has a primarily black cast, sometimes suffer in Hollywood because of a belief, however invalid, that they â€œdonâ€™t travelâ€ù â€” that movies with white leads stand a better chance of attracting audiences overseas",,
7020," Is that a concern here?â€œNo,â€ù Mr",,
7020, Swinkels said flatly,,
7020, â€œItâ€™s a universal story,,
7020,"â€ùTracy Oliver, who wrote the screenplay for â€œGirls Tripâ€ù with Kenya Barris, said in an email that she recently participated in a workshop at the University of California, Los Angeles where visiting students from Germany went to see the film and then participated in a discussion",,
7020," â€œGiven the entire class was white and were from Germany, I didnâ€™t know what to expect,â€ù Ms",,
7020, Oliver said,,
7020," â€œNot only did they understand it, they loved it",,
7020,"â€ùShe added, â€œIâ€™m hopeful that people wonâ€™t assume certain countries and territories wonâ€™t support it and not even play the movie there",,
7020, I saw firsthand how well this movie translates to an audience that shares very little in common culturally with the cast,,

7023,The worldwide turbulence of recent days is a strong indication that government intervention alone cannot restore the economy and offers a glimpse of the risk of completely depending on it,,
7023, It is time to give the free market a chance,,
7023,"Since the crash of 2008, governments have tried to stimulate their economies by a variety of means but have relied heavily on manipulating interest rates lower through one form or other of quantitative easing or simply printing money",,
7023," The immediate rescue of the collapsing economy was necessary at the time, but the manipulation has now gone on for nearly seven years and has produced many unwanted consequences",,
7023,It has exacerbated the inequality of income around the world,,
7023, Money has been artificially allocated by the abnormally low rates to reward speculation and to discourage savings and longer-term investments that produce real economic and employment growth,,
7023,"The Federal Reserve, waiting for signs of inflation to change its policies, seems to be looking at the wrong data",,
7023," Actually its policies have been highly effective in the areas stimulated most heavily, but the low interest rate policies have not stimulated the broad economy or made most people better off",,
7023," In fact, it may have actually hurt those people",,
7023,"Low interest rates have hugely lifted assets largely owned by the very rich, and inflation in these areas is clearly apparent",,
7023," Stocks have tripled and real estate prices in the major cities where the wealthy live have been soaring, as have the prices of artwork and the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods",,
7023,"Cheap financing has led to a boom in speculative activity, and mergers and acquisitions",,
7023, Most acquisitions are justified by â€œefficienciesâ€ù which is usually a euphemism for layoffs,,
7023," Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, one of the nationâ€™s most active acquirers, routinely fires â€œredundantâ€ù workers after each acquisition to enhance reported earnings",,
7023," This elevates its stock, with which it makes the next acquisition",,
7023," With money cheap, corporate executives have used cash flow to buy back stock, enhancing the value of their options, instead of investing for the future",,
7023," This pattern, and the fear it engenders, has added to downward pressure on employment and wages",,
7023,"Similarly, older adults and those on fixed incomes are getting next to nothing on their savings",,
7023," In a typical bank today, $1 million astonishingly yields only about $2,000 a year",,
7023," As interest income has fallen for seniors, their spending has understandably moderated",,
7023," Thus consumer spending, which would have otherwise expanded the broad economy, has been sluggish",,
7023,Extended Fed intervention has actually increased the risks of severe trouble ahead,,
7023," Many pension systems are woefully underfunded because, while their liabilities are fixed, their fixed-income investments yield far below their actuarial assumptions",,
7023, This forces them to take greater risks or to seek other means to close the gap,,
7023, Historically this hasnâ€™t ended well,,
7023,"So, the income gap widens",,
7023," The rich get richer and most of the country is treading water at best, not what one would expect from a Democratic administration ostensibly committed to the broader public",,
7023,"Another risk of the current policy is that investors, rather than doing their own thinking, have increasingly been taking their cue from the Fed",,
7023," They are addicted to stimulus, like a drug",,
7023," In the short term, markets are gyrating less on an analysis of fundamentals and more, buffeted by the endless speculation of the talking heads, on the basis of whether they believe they can rely on the Fed to enrich them or bail them out",,
7023,An even more concerning trend has emerged in the last few weeks,,
7023," With huge Chinese stimulus failing to support its manipulated stock market through currency devaluation, cash infusions and eased rules, the presumed confidence in the ability of central banks to control economies has come into question",,
7023," Further, there is a growing realization that, by keeping interest rates at essentially zero, the tools the central banks have available to arrest another decline are very limited",,
7023,The Fed should raise rates in September,,
7023, The focus on a quarter-point change in short rates and its precise date of imposition is foolishness,,
7023, Expected rates of return on new investments are typically well above 10 percent,,
7023, No sensible businessman would defer a sound investment because short-term rates are slightly higher for a few months,,
7023, They either have a sound investment or they donâ€™t,,
7023, The reluctance to raise rates now would likely do more harm than good as it would suggest to investors that the Fed foresees a more fragile recovery,,
7023," This might encourage the businessman to hold off on planned investments, further undermining the recovery",,

7026,Avonâ€™s fading beauty is in the eyes of two different financial beholders,,
7026,The struggling makeup company has come under fire from an aggressive investor and may call on a buyout shop for help,,
7026, The growing role of private equity firms as white knights against activist investors suggests that target companies are not the only ones with troubles,,
7026,"It has been a swift decline for Avon Products, the 130-year-old American symbol of door-to-door perfume sales",,
7026," After snubbing an $11 billion bid from rival Coty some three years ago, the companyâ€™s sales and shares have tumbled, leaving it worth just $1",,
7026,8 billion now,,
7026," A hedge fund, Barington Capital, sees value in Avon, but only with a new board and management willing to slash costs and reinvest in its global brand",,
7026,"The current boss, Sheri McCoy, has other ideas",,
7026," Avon is in talks to sell its North American business to Cerberus Capital Management, which would simultaneously make a minority investment in the public companyâ€™s capital",,
7026, Thatâ€™s an increasingly popular playbook for companies under siege,,
7026,"In August, the walkie-talkie maker Motorola Solutions, in which Jeffrey W",,
7026," Ubbenâ€™s ValueAct Capital is both an investor and director, turned to the private equity firm Silver Lake for assistance",,
7026," Silver Lake invested $1 billion in the form of convertible bonds that pay 2 percent, which helped Motorola buy back its stock",,
7026, Silver Lake also put two managing partners on Motorolaâ€™s board,,
7026,NCR pulled the same trick a couple of months later,,
7026, A failed sale process led to the Blackstone Group pumping $820 million into NCR using a preferred security that carries a 5,,
7026,"5 percent dividend, payable in kind for the first four years",,
7026," The deal, which also partly paid for a share repurchase, led to the resignation of one activist, Richard McGuireâ€™s Marcato Capital Management, from NCRâ€™s board and raised concerns from another of its investors, Peter Schoenfeld",,
7026,"These private investments in public equities, so-called PIPEs, may come with some attractive terms, but they undermine a primary objective of the buyout business model",,
7026, Taking control and restructuring companies away from the uncomfortable glare of public markets has been a winning strategy,,
7026," With so much dry powder stockpiled, however, private equity firms are getting more creative",,
7026, The danger is that too much of this lipstick gets applied to a variety of pigs,,
7027,"If youâ€™re worried about the stock market, find someone to give you a hug",,
7027,Let me explain,,
7027, Humans are wired to want more of what gives us security and pleasure and to run away from things that cause us pain,,
7027," This behavior has likely kept us alive as a species, but it creates havoc when we invest",,
7027,"When the markets go down, and the financial pornography networks start yelling that you should save yourself before you end up living under a bridge, it feels like a wild animal is chasing you",,
7027," The only thing to do is run!Feeling scared is normal at that moment, and the last thing you need is a lecture from me on the history of long-term stock market returns",,
7027, You donâ€™t need facts and figures; you need a hug! You need someone to listen to you,,
7027," You need empathy, kind murmurings, physical affection",,
7027, An embrace,,
7027,"After the hugging is over and everyone is feeling reasonable again, we can review the careful analytical work that went into designing your portfolio",,
7027, We can revisit the goals and values that we baked into that analysis,,
7027, We can even consider the weighty evidence of history and talk about how the best thing we can do is stay invested,,
7027, All of that is important,,
7027,"But first, a big bear hug",,
7027, Feel better now?,,
7028,Few places in the world are as married to the water as Venice,,
7028," Not only has the Floating City replaced streets with canals and land with islands, but its buildings also sit on wooden piles, driven into the ground deep below the water",,
7028," Like much of the sea-hugging world, the city is also facing an existential threat as the waters rise and its ground sinks",,
7028,The cityâ€™s art and architecture Biennales (the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale starts on Saturday and runs through Nov,,
7028," 11) have long reflected this simultaneously magical and dire condition, with exhibit after exhibit addressing sustainable architecture, climate change and rising seas",,
7028,"Many have even drifted along Veniceâ€™s canals themselves, including Mike Bouchetâ€™s (doomed) floating house; Croatiaâ€™s floating pavilion; Kunle Adeyemiâ€™s floating school; Joana Vasconcelosâ€™ floating artwork, Trafaria Praia; and Aldo Rossiâ€™s floating Theater of the World",,
7028,"As is so often the case, life is imitating art, and floating architecture is emerging as one of the built worldâ€™s most promising markets â€” for many of the reasons pinpointed at the Biennale",,
7028,"â€œWe see architects as spanning between infrastructural ideas and society,â€ù said Yvonne Farrell, one of the Biennaleâ€™s directors, who posits that if architects can take a leading role on vital environmental issues through emerging technologies like floating buildings, then they can also help re-establish their primacy in the construction process",,
7028,â€œYou cannot not deal with environmental issues if youâ€™re an architect these days,,
7028," It has to be an essential part of your value system,â€ù added Shelley McNamara, who is also one of the directors",,
7028, â€œWeâ€™re all connected,,
7028, We have to find solutions where art and culture and industry can all find a way to survive,,
7028,"â€ùArchitects, boat builders, developers and city planners worldwide are seizing on the opportunity as cities run out of space to build, tides continue to rise and demand for efficient construction spikes",,
7028," Theyâ€™re creating inventive designer homes and floating resorts, and even floating cities that can be prefabricated off site and simply floated into place",,
7028,"â€œFor many, floating is something new and adventurous,â€ù said Max Funk, co-editor of â€œRock the Boat: Boats, Cabins and Homes on the Waterâ€ù (Gestalten, 2017)",,
7028," The book reveals an explosion of creativity in buoyant architecture, including an egg-shaped floating cabin in England, floating spas (with working saunas) in Finland and the United States, and floating geodesic domes in Slovenia",,
7028,"â€œHaving a floating home used to be something only for vacationers or the uber-wealthy,â€ù Mr",,
7028, Funk said,,

7028," It has state-of-the-art amenities like Wi-Fi, onboard water filtration and solar power",,
7028," It has its own motor (technically making it a houseboat), and Mr",,

7028,â€ùOn Seattleâ€™s Lake Union â€” which has hosted floating homes since the 1920s and now has more than 500 of them â€” William Donnelly has lived in a multilevel floating home designed by Vandeventer & Carlander architects for more than seven years,,
7028,"â€œI enjoy smelling the water, hearing the water,â€ù he said",,
7028, â€œI love the idea that my home isnâ€™t fixed to the land,,
7028, Itâ€™s freeing,,
7028,"â€ù Itâ€™s not all perfect â€” the lake is popular, and sometimes his tightly surrounded home feels like a fishbowl â€” but he said that he would never live on land again",,
7028,"Thanks to such situations, and to the rise in the price of waterfront property, the market for floating architecture is growing in North America, said Allison Bethell, a real estate investor analyst at FitSmallBusiness",,
7028,com,,
7028," Newer homes and their slips are not cheap, but since the market is young and houses are limited in size, they are rarely as expensive as prime waterfront real estate",,
7028,"Outside of Seattle, where houseboat construction is being curtailed because of the potential impact on local salmon populations, Ms",,
7028," Bethell said, the most prominent areas in North America for floating homes are the San Francisco Bay Area; Vancouver, British Columbia; Key West, Fla",,
7028,"; and Portland, Ore",,
7028,; where the number of floating homes has doubled since 2012,,
7028,"The trend is also expanding rapidly in Asia and the Middle East, but it is furthest along in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, which is mostly below sea level",,
7028," Estimates report that the country now has more than 10,000 floating residents, none more densely packed than in Ijburg, a growing development of floating homes clustered off man-made islands on the eastern edge of Amsterdam",,
7028,Over 50 of these residences â€” featured in the 2014 U,,
7028,K,,
7028, Pavilion at the Venice Biennale â€” were designed by Marlies Rohmer Architects & Urbanists and developed by Amsterdam-based Monteflore,,
7028," The simple, industrial-inspired homes, floating on concrete bases (the current norm) were fabricated in a factory and floated into place",,
7028,"â€œMost of the world now lives in cities, and most cities are near water,â€ù said Ton van Namen, managing director of Monteflore",,
7028," He said his team was working on a floating development along the west coast of Wales, and had been approached by interested parties from China, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Dubai and Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates",,
7028,"Koen Olthuis, an architect from the Netherlands who founded Waterstudio",,
7028,"NL, one of more than a dozen European firms specializing in boutique buoyant homes, sees floating architecture as the future",,
7028," He said he had built more than 150 floating residences in the last 15 years, including a group of floating villas in Dordrecht, south of Rotterdam, that use heat exchange power and have extra-large foundations to create terraces and other outdoor spaces",,
7028,"Now he is increasing his repertoire as both a designer and a planning consultant for floating hotels, restaurants, stores, resorts and private islands, and even floating cities",,
7028,"â€œBlue cities,â€ù as he calls them, can be more flexible and eclectic, and respond faster to rapidly changing demands from society and industry",,
7028,"â€œIâ€™ve talked to many urban planners, and they all say the same thing â€” by the time a cityâ€™s plan is finished, itâ€™s no longer in line with society",,
7028,"â€ùHe has consulted with officials in Rotterdam, the Maldives, Ivory Coast and Saudi Arabia, on flood-safe construction, smoother regulations for floating architecture, and how to float needed facilities, like a harbor, into place when needed",,
7028, He envisions floating museums and factories shared by nearby cities,,
7028,"â€œOnce the elevator was invented, the whole recipe for a city changed,â€ù Mr",,
7028, Olthuis said,,
7028, â€œNow a similar thing is happening on the water,,
7028,"â€ùThe transformation of the typical floating building is, like most things in Dubai, going ahead full steam â€” thanks in large part to the Finnish company Admares, whose chief executive, Mikael Hedberg, started as a shipbuilder and now merges land and sea-based construction technologies",,
7028,"Admares in 2016 completed the Burj Al Arab Terrace, a 2",,
7028,"3-acre island, attached to the sail-like Burj Al Arab tower, containing pools, cabanas, sun loungers, and a restaurant and bar",,
7028," It was built in a factory in Rauma, Finland, floated into place in six pieces and then driven into the seabed via piles",,
7028,"Besides location, what especially draws clients, Mr",,
7028," Hedberg says, is the fact that since structures can be built off-site, on-site construction time is cut way down",,
7028," The Burj Al Arab Terrace was set onto piles and welded together in about three months, subverting a landfill process that can take up to three years",,
7028,"And unlike construction on landfill, floating buildings and islands create minimal ecological disturbance",,
7028," Often floating platforms and piles, like those at the Terrace, serve as habitats and valuable cover for marine life",,
7028,"The rise of floating design â€” and issues related to both rising tides and sinking cities â€” are having a clear impact on land, where designers and officials contend with water whether they like it or not",,
7028," In many ways, floating buildings serve as laboratories for our new environmental reality",,
7028,Mr,,
7028," Olthuis has helped create a development in Utrecht, the Netherlands, where â€œamphibiousâ€ù homes â€” sitting on buoyant concrete bases and tethered to supports â€” can float in the event of flooding",,
7028," (The Los Angeles firm Morphosis created a similar system for its modular, foam-cored Float House in flood-prone New Orleans",,
7028,") He is also developing hybrid structures that can float on the water and, through a jack system, sit on land, making them even more flexible to personal and urban change",,
7028,"â€œLand itself is no longer fixed in the way weâ€™ve traditionally seen,â€ù said Kristen Hall, an urban designer at Perkins & Will, which is incorporating water-reactive solutions for its new Mission Rock development at San Franciscoâ€™s Mission Bay, like pile-supported buildings, streets and sidewalks, and flexible utilities",,
7028," â€œThe question is, how much do you plan for change and roll with the change, and how much do you try to resist the change?â€ù",,
7029,"To President Trump and congressional Republicans, the overhaul of the tax code that became law on Friday will make the United States a better place to do business",,
7029," To the rest of the world, it has the potential to challenge the global economic order, creating an uneven playing field and setting off a race among countries to cut corporate taxes",,
7029,"The overhaul is already threatening economic relations, adding to concerns that Mr",,
7029, Trump is advancing a nationalistic agenda at the expense of other countries,,
7029,"European leaders this week raised the prospect of a trade battle, implying that they may fight the new tax rules before the World Trade Organization",,
7029, Chinese officials are readying defensive measures to protect the countryâ€™s economy and its competitiveness,,

7029, â€œWeâ€™re going to bring back our companies,,
7029, Theyâ€™ve already started coming back,,
7029,â€ùIt all starts with the corporate tax rate,,
7029,"The new rate â€” down to 21 percent, from 35 percent â€” takes the United States from the top of the global tax spectrum to the lower end",,
7029," Countries like Australia, France, Germany and Japan, all of which have effective corporate tax rates of at least 30 percent, will be under pressure to follow",,
7029,"â€œItâ€™s a huge incentive to governments around the world who want to see more investment to be part of that,â€ù said Andrew Mackenzie, the chief executive of the mining giant BHP, which has its headquarters in Australia and major operations in North and South America",,
7029, â€œThey will have to follow suit,,
7029,â€ùCorporate rates were already on a downward trajectory,,
7029," Many countries have used low taxes as an advantage over the United States, which offers a huge domestic market, plentiful venture capital and relatively light workplace regulation",,
7029,"â€œThere will be pressure for a new round of lowering corporate taxes,â€ù said Stefano Micossi, the director general of Assonime, an Italian association of publicly listed companies",,
7029,"China, a frequent target of Mr",,
7029," Trumpâ€™s over its trade practices, may also be forced to play the tax game",,
7029,"For all of its appeal as a manufacturing hub thanks to its skilled work force, solid infrastructure and other benefits, China charges high taxes",,
7029," On top of a standard corporate rate of 25 percent, companies are required to make social security contributions and other payments that push their tax burden higher there than it is in many other countries",,
7029,"Last week, Chinaâ€™s vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, pledged to â€œtake proactive measuresâ€ù in response to the tax overhaul, according to Xinhua, Chinaâ€™s state-run news agency",,
7029," â€œThe external impact of tax policy change in the worldâ€™s largest economy cannot be overlooked,â€ù Mr",,
7029," Zhu said, according to Xinhua",,
7029,Mr,,
7029," Zhu did not offer details about the measures China might take, but they could include streamlining regulations that foreign businesses face, or deferring certain taxes if money is reinvested locally, according to Andrew Choy, a tax partner for Greater China at EY",,
7029,Deep in the tax packageâ€™s fine print were provisions that looked like protectionism to Asian and European companies,,
7029,"The European Commission, which manages the European Union, objected to a tax break that companies in the United States would get for so-called foreign-derived intangible income â€” money they make from selling property or services abroad",,
7029,The measure is supposed to encourage companies to produce goods in the United States and sell them overseas,,
7029, But European officials said the provision appeared to violate agreements among countries against subsidizing their exports,,
7029,"â€œThe commission will reflect on all possible measures that may need to be taken if the bill enters into force as agreed today,â€ù the commission said in a statement",,
7029, â€œAll options are on the table,,
7029,"â€ùâ€œAs the worldâ€™s largest economy, we would expect the U",,
7029,S,,
7029, to ensure that tax reform will be nondiscriminatory and in line with its W,,
7029,T,,
7029,O,,
7029," obligations,â€ù the commission said",,
7029,The commission also said that a measure in the bill known as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax â€œappears to be discriminatoryâ€ù  against foreign companies,,
7029,The provision is meant to keep companies from shifting income to low-tax countries,,
7029," But it adds a levy to some transactions between a bank or insurance companyâ€™s American operations and its foreign affiliates, which would affect real deals, not just tax maneuvers",,
7029, The Swiss bank Credit Suisse said on Friday that it would have to cut $2,,
7029,3 billion from fourth-quarter profit because of the new tax regime,,
7029,"The tax â€œmay harmfully distort international financial markets,â€ù a group of European finance ministers wrote to officials in the United States last week",,
7029,"In China, officials are preparing to deal with a wrinkle unique to their country: a challenge to tough Chinese laws that keep money from leaving its borders",,
7029,"China sets tight controls on how much money flows out of the country, as a way of controlling the value of its currency and keeping its financial system stable",,
7029," Companies that want to take more than $5 million out of the country must apply for permission from Chinaâ€™s central bank, a process that can take months",,
7029," The limits, which were tightened last year as Beijing tried to stem a tide of money leaving the country, have led to complaints from foreign companies doing business there",,
7029,"â€œCompanies know that when they send money to China, itâ€™s basically a one-way gate,â€ù said Christopher Balding, an associate professor of finance at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen, China",,
7029,Some Chinese officials worry that the tax measure will cause more American companies to try to take money out and are mulling new restrictions on capital flows,,
7029," The newly approved tax incentives could appeal to companies that are frustrated by Chinaâ€™s rising labor costs, ambitious local competitors and tangled legal systems, or that would rather spend their money at home or elsewhere",,
7029,How much money American companies keep in China â€” and how much they would want to bring home â€” is unclear,,
7029, Many firms use accounting techniques and complicated cost-sharing arrangements with other companies to book profits in other countries,,
7029,Companies with big investment plans in China would probably prefer to keep the money there than to bring it home; others may simply want to keep it there on a bet that Chinaâ€™s currency will strengthen in value,,
7029,Experts said it was unlikely to come anywhere close to the flood of outflows that has prompted China to spend $1 trillion in recent years to prop up its currency,,
7029," Still, tax experts say, some American companies are exploring their options",,
7029,"Patrick Yip, a tax partner at Deloitte China, estimated that his clients â€” large companies with many years of experience in China â€” could move $20 million to $30 million on average from the country over the next year",,
7029," Some clients who have accumulated as much as $80 million or $90 million in recent years could look to bring that money back, he said",,
7029,"â€œWe have clients who are in the process of thinking about where to deploy their investments,â€ù he said",,
7030,Good morning on this toasty Friday,,
7030,"After the deadly terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday, in which six of the eight killed were international tourists, we wondered:Will more foreign visitors avoid New York now?With the New York City Marathon on Sunday and the holiday season approaching, we asked Christopher Heywood, a senior vice president of NYC & Company, the cityâ€™s tourism arm, how terrorism affects tourism",,
7030,"When would we see, if at all, the ripple effects on tourism to our city?â€œNormally, with something like this, you would see the effects pretty quickly,â€ù he said",,
7030," Signs of a slowdown could include a decline in hotel demand or the cancellation of meetings, conventions or groups",,
7030," That hasnâ€™t happened, he added",,
7030, A positive indicator is that the city continued with the Halloween parade and the marathon,,
7030," â€œGenerally, if transportation and infrastructure have not been affected then youâ€™re going to see an immediate bounce-back,â€ù Mr",,
7030, Heywood said,,
7030,How did the attacks on 9/11 affect tourism?The number of international visitors declined from about 6,,
7030,8 million in 2000 to about 5,,
7030,"7 million in 2001, with most of that loss coming after Sept",,
7030," 11, according to NYC & Companyâ€™s data",,
7030, International travel to New York declined for the next two years,,
7030, It took five years for international tourism to reach pre-9/11 levels,,
7030, But there was at least one tourism bright spot: The city got a small boost in 2002 from domestic â€œpatriotic tourism,,
7030,"â€ùWhich countries do the most tourists come from?In 2016, the five largest international markets to the city were the United Kingdom (1,239,000 visitors), China (951,000), Canada (928,000), Brazil (818,000) and France (745,000)",,
7030,"Has the attack affected Sundayâ€™s marathon?Chris Weiller, a spokesman for New York Road Runners, which runs the event, said that, typically, 1 percent of runners cancel for personal reasons",,
7030," There hasnâ€™t been an uptick in cancellations this year, he said",,
7030," The police department is stepping up security measures, like doubling the number of sniper teams and adding more sand trucks, to protect the 51,000 runners and more than 2",,

7031,"FRANKFURT â€” Economic growth in the eurozone has fallen to its slowest pace in more than four years, and Italy is not growing at all, according to figures released Tuesday",,
7031, The snapshot is likely to sharpen political divisions in the European Union and make the region more vulnerable to the forces rattling financial markets,,
7031,The eurozone grew 0,,
7031,"2 percent from July through September compared with the previous quarter, according to the European Union statistics agency",,
7031," Separately, Italyâ€™s government statistics office said growth during the third quarter was zero as manufacturing slumped",,
7031,Both numbers were unexpectedly poor,,
7031," Eurozone growth in the quarter was only half as fast as it had been in the previous three-month period, and the rate of growth has fallen each of the last three quarters",,
7031,Italyâ€™s stagnation is likely to heighten the dispute between the populist government in Rome and officials in Brussels,,
7031, The European Commission has said that Italyâ€™s proposed budget â€” full of debt-financed welfare programs â€” flouts spending limits that countries in the European Union are supposed to observe,,
7031,One of the European Commissionâ€™s criticisms of the Italian budget is that it was based on overly optimistic estimates of future economic growth,,
7031, Now those estimates look even less realistic,,
7031,Investors registered their disappointment by bidding up the market interest rate on Italian government bonds on Tuesday,,
7031, That will only amplify the countryâ€™s problems,,
7031,The rates on government bonds serve as benchmarks for the rates that Italians pay on business or consumer loans,,
7031, Higher rates will squeeze spending and lead to yet slower growth,,
7031,"â€œItâ€™s a self-defeating cycle,â€ù said Lorenzo Codogno, chief economist at LC Macro Advisors in London",,
7031, â€œThe government is shooting itself in the foot,,
7031,â€ùBut Mr,,
7031," Codogno said he doubted that the populist parties governing Italy would retreat from their campaign promises, such as increases in pensions",,
7031," To do so, he said, â€œwould be political suicide",,
7031,â€ùAnd Italy is not the only country in the eurozone facing political instability,,
7031,"Germany is facing a difficult transition after Angela Merkel, the chancellor for 13 years, said on Monday that she would give up leadership of her conservative party in December and not seek re-election in 2021",,
7031, The surprise announcement came after elections in the state of Hesse underlined a migration of voters from centrist parties to parties on the far left and far right,,
7031,The eurozone growth figure published Tuesday was a first estimate and contained no detail about what sectors led to the slowdown,,
7031," Still, the causes are obvious enough",,
7031,They include the prospect that Britainâ€™s separation from the European Union will be disruptive; a trade war with the United States that has interfered with trans-Atlantic commerce; and rising interest rates as central banks roll back the stimulus programs they used to combat the last financial crisis,,
7031,Those risks are accumulating at the same time that financial markets are unusually nervous,,
7031," Daily fluctuations in the prices of stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities like gold and copper are at their most extreme levels since 2008, when the last global financial crisis began, according to data compiled by analysts at the German bank Berenberg",,
7031,"The one somewhat bright spot in the numbers Tuesday was France, which registered growth of 0",,
7031,4 percent from the previous quarter,,
7031," But, coming after two weaker quarters, even that above-average result was not enough to achieve the 1",,
7031,7 percent pace of expansion that economist say President Emmanuel Macron needs to validate his program of business-friendly reforms,,
7031,"The reforms have not yet brought widespread economic gains or job creation, damaging Mr",,
7031, Macronâ€™s popularity with voters,,
7031, The government needs the economy to expand by around 1,,
7031,"7 percent in each of the next four years if it is to maintain a pledge to cut unemployment to 7 percent, from more than 9 percent today, by the next presidential election, economists say",,
7031,"The disappointing growth in the eurozone as a whole was partly caused by factors that arenâ€™t likely to repeat, leaving room for hope that growth will pick up toward the end of the year",,
7031,"For example, European car sales slumped 24 percent in September as auto manufacturers struggled to comply with new, stricter emissions standards",,
7031, Cars were slow to reach dealers because of delays in getting regulators to certify vehicles for sale,,
7031, Manufacturers such as BMW and Daimler have also been caught in the crossfire of President Trumpâ€™s trade war with China,,
7031,"The slowdown in the car industry rippled through the eurozone and was probably most pronounced in Germany, the Continentâ€™s largest economy and motor of growth",,
7031," Registrations of new Volkswagens slumped by nearly half in September, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association",,
7031," The company at least temporarily lost its long-held status as the Continentâ€™s largest auto manufacturer to PSA of France, the maker of Peugeot and CitroÃ«n cars",,
7031,"The brake on growth caused by the auto industry should dissipate soon, â€œand the euro economy is likely to grow more strongly again,â€ù Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients Tuesday",,
7031,"But many other risks will remain, particularly Italy and a government seen by investors as reckless and determined to defy Brussels",,
7031," The ultimate question facing the eurozone, and the world for that matter, is whether the problems of Italy and the tremors in financial markets signal another crisis",,
7031,"Bernd Meyer, chief strategist for wealth and asset management at Berenberg, pointed out that prices for tech stocks or real estate were not at the extreme levels that preceded past meltdowns",,
7031,"During a meeting with reporters Tuesday, Mr",,
7031, Meyer argued that market pressure on Italy will eventually force the government to relent on its spending plans,,
7031," But, he added, â€œthey will only back down when they are staring into the abyss",,
7031,â€ùOthers are less sanguine about the eurozoneâ€™s prospects,,
7031," Nicola Nobile, lead economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm, noted that the European Commissionâ€™s survey of economic sentiment also slipped Tuesday, though it remains well above crisis levels",,
7031,"â€œRecent surveys,â€ù Mr",,
7031," Nobile said in a note to clients, â€œare painting a rather bleak picture of eurozone growth",,
7031,â€ù,,
7032,Even some of the smartest guys in the room got this one wrong,,
7032,The billionaire hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman told an audience of Wall Street insiders on Wednesday that there was a 70 percent probability that Britain would stay inside the European Union,,
7032," â€œI donâ€™t worry about Brexit,â€ù he added",,
7032,"Two weeks earlier, George Soros, who became known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, said he was â€œconfident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the â€˜remainâ€™ camp is getting stronger",,
7032,"â€ùâ€œMarkets are not always right, but in this case I agree with them,â€ù Mr",,
7032, Soros added,,
7032,"Then on Thursday, the British electorate voted to leave",,
7032," The reaction in markets was swift and violent: Stocks around the world went into free fall, the British pound sank to a more than 30-year low against the dollar, and central banks pledged to provide emergency help",,
7032,"Ben Hunt of Salient Partners, went as far as to call it a â€œBear Stearns moment,â€ù evoking the investment firm whose collapse in March 2008 was a prelude to the financial chaos that September",,
7032,"Yet even as the most successful hedge fund managers now survey a sea of down markets, panic has not gripped the industry",,
7032, Thatâ€™s because many hedge fund managers watched the elections from the sidelines,,
7032, Any winners and losers will be determined in the days and weeks after the vote,,
7032,â€œWeâ€™re not in panic mode,,
7032," Weâ€™re just trying to get a sense of things,â€ù said Hans Humes, who runs Greylock Capital, a hedge fund firm that specializes in distressed bonds, adding that Greylock did not make any bets on the Brexit poll",,
7032,"â€œThere was a ton of cash on the sidelines,â€ù he added",,
7032,"Britainâ€™s vote to leave the European Union poses difficult questions for investment firms like Greylock, which made big bets on Greece as it teetered on the brink of economic collapse",,
7032," At a time when many European countries are dealing with flagging economies, Mr",,
7032," Humes said he was concerned that the Brexit vote would feed a growing populist surge across the Continent, threatening to chip away at the foundation of the European Union",,
7032,"Other managers sold their risky assets as the markets climbed higher ahead of the vote in anticipation of a â€œremainâ€ù vote, said Troy Gayeski of SkyBridge Capital, a $12",,
7032,5 billion firm that invests in hedge fund portfolios,,
7032,"â€œVery few, if any, were so convinced that Brexit was going to happen that they would risk enough capital to make money from it,â€ù he said",,
7032,Jason N,,
7032," Ader, chief investment officer of the hedge fund SpringOwl Asset Management, said his firm bet against a basket of companies with high exposure to the British pound going into the poll on Thursday to counteract a potential hit to one of his firmâ€™s biggest investments, in GVC Holdings, a British online-gambling company",,
7032,"As to whether he planned to make any fresh bets after the vote, Mr",,
7032," Ader said, â€œThis will take a long time to shake out",,
7032,â€ùIt may not be surprising that a number of hedge funds are proceeding with caution,,
7032," The last major episode of market turmoil, when Chinese stocks tumbled last summer, sent many hedge funds reeling",,
7032, Some have yet to recover,,
7032,"Even as few major winners have emerged, anyone who had large holdings in safe havens like Treasury securities and gold â€” which rose sharply on Friday â€” looked smart the day after the vote",,
7032, That includes Mr,,
7032," Soros, who told The Wall Street Journal that he didnâ€™t think a Brexit was likely in an interview just a few weeks ago",,
7032," His Soros Fund Management has taken long positions in gold through an exchange-traded fund, according to recent regulatory filings",,
7032,Whether Mr,,
7032, Soros took any positions to profit from a Brexit is unclear,,
7032," A day after the referendum, he warned of the consequences of the Brexit vote",,
7032,"â€œThe consequences for the real economy will be comparable only to the financial crisis of 2007-2008,â€ù he wrote in a post on the opinion website Project Syndicate",,
7032,Mr,,
7032," Cooperman, who cited optimistic figures about the â€œremainâ€ù vote, also sounded a cautious note when he spoke at a Youth INC charity event at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan on Wednesday",,
7032,"â€œI think Brexit is going to have a very negative impact on Europe if it happens,â€ù Mr",,
7032, Cooperman told an audience of investment professionals,,
7032,"By Friday, he had adopted a darker view",,
7032,"â€œMy friend at Microsoft was dead wrong, as was I,â€ù Mr",,
7032," Cooperman said, referring to the source of his optimistic probability of Britainâ€™s voting to remain",,
7032,"â€œThis, too, shall pass",,
7032,â€ù,,
7034,"In the paintings of the 19th-century Danish artist Vilhelm Hammershoi, the color gray achieves a beguiling incandescence",,
7034," His introspective interiors, which feature the simple, classical architecture of 18th-century Copenhagen apartments bathed in Scandinaviaâ€™s soft northern light, present havens of timeless tranquillity",,
7034, Entering Oliver Gustavâ€™s home is not unlike stepping into one of Hammershoiâ€™s paintings,,
7034," For one thing, it is in a building quite similar to Strandgade 30, where the painter and his wife lived for 10 years, and which served as a setting for his most important works",,
7034, But itâ€™s also the stillness and the way the light softens the sharp angles of each room,,
7034,"Gustav is best known for his stores in New York and Copenhagen, where he shows the work of contemporary designers â€” Vincenzo De Cotiis, Rick Owens, Faye Toogood and Michael Verheyden among others â€” alongside 17th-century antiques and his own line of furniture",,
7034," But it is here, in the Copenhagen apartment he shares with his partner, that his vision is fully expressed",,
7034, The first thing you notice is the dramatic slant of the floor,,
7034," â€œI always fall in love with crooked places,â€ù the 38-year-old designer says",,
7034," Foundations of buildings such as his are oak, he explains, which tend to shift over the course of hundreds of years",,
7034," The structure, built in 1734, is listed by the government as a building of architectural significance",,
7034," Danes take their historical preservation seriously; there is virtually nothing you can change about a listed building â€” not the sloping floors, not the tiny kitchen, not the placement of outlets or switches, nor the moldings or windows",,
7034," Adjacent to the entrance of Gustavâ€™s apartment, for example, is what appears to be a shower door to the only â€œbathroomâ€ù in the 2,000-square-foot apartment",,
7034," It is, in fact, no bigger than a shower stall, with a toilet and sink wedged into corners and a drain in the center of the floor",,
7034," â€œItâ€™s wonderful to step back in time,â€ù Gustav says with a smile, â€œbut itâ€™s not necessarily very practical",,
7034,"â€ùYet were it not for these restrictions, the bones of the apartment would have been lost long ago, as would have the unsealed pine floors, colored a warm light gray that is often imitated with bleaches and stains but is naturally achieved with the passage of time",,
7034, Gustav painted the walls in a matte mineral paint from Germany that highlights the subtle texture of the old plaster,,
7034," Many of the original windowpanes, too, remain intact, and the wavy glass helps to diffuse the spare winter light, such a precious commodity for Danes",,
7034," â€œIt is not the cold that makes the winters so long here,â€ù explains Gustavâ€™s partner, â€œbut the darkness",,
7034,"â€ùTo this historically correct backdrop Gustav has added deep sofas and chairs covered in heavy linens as well as 18th-century antiques, providing a stately backdrop for the edgier art and objects scattered throughout",,
7034," â€œI fall in love with textures and materials â€” things that are heavy and raw,â€ù he says",,
7034," Pieces like a large aluminum disk lamp by Kevin Josias, oxidized to a soft silver, manage to both blend into the elegant interior and provide a note that feels slightly at odds with it",,
7034," â€œI always need something that irritates the eye,â€ù Gustav says, though irritation is not quite right: The result is more quietly subversive",,
7034," He says his grandfather, a blacksmith who â€œhad a beautiful sense of nothing,â€ù influenced his sensibility",,
7034," But Gustavâ€™s rooms, though spare, are hardly minimalist",,
7034,"â€œPeople have described my work as dunkelâ€ù â€” which translates to â€œdarkâ€ù or â€œmurkyâ€ù â€” â€œbut I think itâ€™s more playful,â€ù says Gustav, whose sparkling blue eyes and broad smile are warm and welcoming â€” more hyggeligt, you could say, the Danish word for â€œcozyâ€ù that has recently gained traction in the rest of the world",,
7034," The apartment lies somewhere in between, an exchange spanning traditional elements, like the white 19th-century ceramic stove in the corner of the living room, and the sometimes melancholy pieces of contemporary art",,
7034," In the dining room a work by Louise Bourgeois reads, â€œThey did this, they did that, my stomach aches, my head aches, my feet hurt, a wounded Lion",,
7034,"â€ùâ€œDanes have been called the happiest people,â€ù Gustav says",,
7034, â€œI wonder how they measure this,,
7034,â€ù His own story is indicative of the more complex realities of growing up in this country,,
7034, His parents moved their family from Copenhagen to a small town when Gustav was a boy,,
7034," The place, rural and conservative, was oppressive to him and he moved back to the city as soon as he could",,
7034," At 17, he was studying business and living in a small studio apartment his parents had purchased for him",,
7034, One day he arrived home to find the locks had been changed,,
7034, Gustav assumed they had finally discovered that he was gay,,
7034, He has not spoken to them since,,
7034,"The resilient teenager, forced to drop out of school, immediately found a job with the creative director of a department store in Copenhagen that sold classic furniture by midcentury modern designers â€” Poul Kjaerholm, Hans Wegner, Arne Jacobsen and the like",,
7034," This led to a job with Tage Andersen, a furniture-maker and set designer with a magnificent silver beard known for his fantastic floral arrangements and otherworldly store in the center of town",,
7034," Gustav remains indebted to his former employer, a champion of singular vision who inspired his own strict work ethic",,
7034," â€œTage works from 5 in the morning to 10 at night,â€ù says Gustav, who parted company with Andersen after six years",,
7034,"In 2009, Gustav rented a charming three-story carriage house where he lived and worked",,
7034, The house was lacking in modern conveniences â€” he had to hang rugs over the windows to survive the winter â€” but it became a sort of calling card for his design,,
7034," The owner of Day Birger et Mikkelsen, one of the countryâ€™s largest fashion houses, saw the place in a magazine and hired him to create a visual identity for her company",,
7034, Gustav began building elaborate sets for events â€” he recreated â€œThe Nutcrackerâ€ù at the French Embassy and an apple orchard in an old warehouse for Louis Vuitton,,
7034, His interior design business flourished as well,,
7034," He collected art, often paying things off over a number of years",,
7034," In 2012, he left the carriage house for another listed home (this time with heat) and opened his shop in the 18th-century neighborhood of Frederiksstaden, where it still stands",,
7034,"â€œI have a love affair with things,â€ù says Gustav, who regularly visits auction houses in Germany and flea markets in France and Denmark, filling his stores with his finds",,
7034, The trouble is parting with them: â€œI only buy those things that I want for myself,,
7034,"â€ù Often, he is so attached to a piece that he canâ€™t bring himself to part with it, to the point where people started joking that nothing in his Copenhagen store was for sale",,
7034," He laughs at this, but also notes that he doesnâ€™t have a need for money",,
7034, â€œI just want a beautiful life,,
7034,"â€ùOn my last day in Copenhagen, Gustav drove me to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, outside the city, to see a Louise Bourgeois exhibition",,
7034," In her powerful sculptures and installations, the artist often explored her complex, sometimes troubled relationships",,
7034," â€œI totally understand her world,â€ù Gustav told me",,
7034, â€œShe is completely true to herself,,
7034,"â€ù I can see why he admires Bourgeoisâ€™s work: His own vision is as steadfast and true, and with his equally evocative interiors heâ€™s found a way of processing his own life",,
7034," â€œMy way of expressing myself is to build my own universe,â€ù and in doing so, he added, â€œI create my own self",,
7034,â€ù,,
7035,"The Trump bump in the stock market ran into trouble when the Republican effort to â€œrepeal and replace Obamacareâ€ù foundered in Congress and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates, raising doubts that developments in Washington would treat the markets as kindly for the rest of the year as they appear to have done right after Election Day",,
7035,"Stocks had recorded a succession of highs in the hope that President Trumpâ€™s proposals for significant infrastructure spending, reduced regulation and an overhaul of the tax code would be enacted and be good for business",,
7035,"But then, the market became choppier",,
7035,"â€œThe realization is setting in that even with a Republican White House and congressional majority, it doesnâ€™t ensure a smooth enactment of legislation,â€ù said Rebecca H",,
7035," Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families",,
7035," Referring to the decline in March that accelerated after the health care bill showed signs of stalling, she added: â€œHow much hope was priced in? Well, that much was priced in",,
7035,"â€ùMaybe more than that, according to Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies",,
7035,"â€œWe need all of the Trump stimulus to take place, and we need a tax cut,â€ù he said, to justify stocksâ€™ trading as high as they are",,
7035, â€œI donâ€™t think either is going to take place in a hurry,,
7035,â€ùIf at all,,
7035," Robert Arnott, co-manager of the Pimco All Asset Fund, said that while the prospect exists for Mr",,
7035," Trump to be â€œa transformational presidentâ€ù who can succeed at â€œdisentangling the regulatory state, cutting a lot of red tape, making it easier for free enterprise to be free, a lot of that is likely to turn out to be wishful thinking",,
7035,â€ùIt was wishful enough to take the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500-stock index up more than 12 percent between Election Day and the beginning of March,,
7035," For the first quarter, the benchmark index rose 5",,
7035,"5 percent, closing at 2,362",,
7035,72,,
7035,"When it comes to the outlook for monetary policy, the thinking is mixed",,
7035, Ms,,
7035," Patterson said the Fedâ€™s move last month â€œwas perceived as an incredibly dovish hike, if thatâ€™s not too much of an oxymoron",,
7035,â€ù Thatâ€™s because Janet L,,
7035," Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, declined to discuss plans for selling trillions of dollars of Treasury instruments and other securities added to the Fedâ€™s balance sheet after the global financial crisis through its quantitative easing program",,
7035,Mr,,
7035, Sri-Kumar envisions a more accommodative Fed than is widely expected,,
7035," The economy will remain too anemic for more than one rate increase a year for the time being, he predicted",,
7035,"Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, counters that central bankers would have to be more assertive because, with the unemployment rate below 5 percent and inflation above 2 percent, â€œthey have met their policy objectives",,
7035,"â€ùâ€œWeâ€™ve moved into a base case where itâ€™s not so much that if the data improves, the Fed will consider raising rates,â€ù Mr",,
7035, Gundlach said,,
7035," â€œNow if the data stays where it is, the Fed will raise rates once a quarter",,
7035, If you look under the hoodâ€ù at Ms,,
7035," Yellenâ€™s commentary last month, â€œit wasnâ€™t that dovish",,
7035,"â€ùTighter monetary policy is ultimately good for long-term government bonds, all else being equal, he said, because it depresses economic growth and inflation",,
7035," As he put it, â€œthe long-bond market wants the Fed to destroy the economy",,
7035,"â€ùBut the economy is still doing well enough to keep the 10-year Treasury yield from falling much further, Mr",,
7035, Gundlach predicted,,
7035, He foresees it falling to 2,,
7035,25 percent from 2,,
7035,"4 percent on March 31, before heading close to 3 percent later in the year",,
7035," He would avoid buying longer-term government debt, therefore, and high-grade corporate bonds, which he said had â€œhuge interest-rate risk",,
7035,"â€ùAs for stocks, they would face pressure from a further rise in bond yields, he warned",,
7035,"â€œThe argument for stocks has for quite some time been that theyâ€™re better than bonds,â€ù Mr",,
7035, Gundlach said,,
7035," â€œAs interest rates move higher, you start to get real competitionâ€ù for investorsâ€™ money",,
7035, â€œItâ€™s going to be a tough environment in the middle of this year with bond yields rising,,
7035,â€ùIt was a sufficiently favorable environment in the first quarter to send the average domestic stock mutual fund up 4,,
7035,"9 percent, according to Morningstar",,
7035," Portfolios that focus on technology and health care did especially well, while specialists in industrials and financial services lagged",,
7035,The average taxable bond fund gained a modest 1,,
7035,6 percent,,
7035,"Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, contends that the economy is humming along better than many on Wall Street believe and that it makes more sense to attribute the rally in stocks to stronger growth than to a Trump bump",,
7035,"â€œThe economy and earnings data were getting better before the elections,â€ù Mr",,
7035," Levkovich said, with measures like new business orders and capital spending already on the rise",,
7035," â€œThe Fed was watching all this data, as well,â€ù he added, and thatâ€™s why it raised rates in March",,
7035,His benign economic view leads him to be wary of bonds; he expects a 10-year Treasury yield of 2,,
7035,"6 percent at yearâ€™s end, and little opportunity for gains",,
7035," He encourages investing in stock sectors that are especially sensitive to growth, like energy â€” which he said had been underperforming technology almost to the extent that it did during the 2000 tech bubble â€” and industrials",,
7035, He also likes narrower segments like biotechnology and producers of entertainment and media content,,
7035,Ms,,
7035, Patterson is less hopeful about the economy and stocks,,
7035," While she finds that economic and earnings growth â€œcontinue to look pretty good,â€ù she thinks a downward turn in the cycle is approaching",,
7035,"â€œWeâ€™ve been neutral on stocks since late spring, and weâ€™ll probably stay neutral until itâ€™s time to go underweight,â€ù she said, adding a caveat: â€œYou donâ€™t want to be too nervous too early",,
7035,â€ùAlthough she is less hopeful on the economy than Mr,,
7035," Levkovich, Ms",,
7035, Patterson likewise favors energy stocks,,
7035," She also recommends health care and would avoid materials stocks, another economically sensitive sector",,
7035,"â€œWe went into the year thinking equities were already highly valued and weâ€™re in the latter stages of the economic cycle,â€ù she said",,
7035," â€œWeâ€™re telling our clients that over the next few years weâ€™ll have positive equity returns, but that they have to manage their expectations",,
7035,"â€ùWith his low expectations for the economy, Mr",,
7035," Sri-Kumar advises a liberal allocation to Treasury and high-grade corporate bonds, and he would limit exposure to the stock market to defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples",,
7035,Investors have seldom felt the need to go into a defensive crouch during the eight-year bull run in stocks,,
7035," The market appears pricey, Mr",,
7035," Arnott said, based on the CAPE Shiller ratio, which compares share prices to the last 10 years of inflation-adjusted earnings to get a valuation reading that adjusts for the shifts of the economic cycle",,
7035,"â€œNow, we sit with a Shiller P",,
7035,E,,
7035," that briefly touched 29,â€ù he said",,
7035," â€œThatâ€™s pretty expensive,â€ù more so than at any time in the last century, he said, other than just before the 1929 crash and in the run-up to the popping of the tech bubble in 2000",,
7035,"â€œThatâ€™s heady company to be keeping,â€ù he said",,
7035," â€œItâ€™s not a slam-dunk formula for a market crash, but it suggests very high odds for long-term anemic returns",,
7035,â€ùMr,,
7035," Arnott finds the return prospects much better abroad, with stocks trading at 13 times earnings in Europe and 12 times in emerging markets",,
7035," As for bonds, local-currency debt in emerging markets yields about 6",,
7035,"5 percent on average, compared with 1",,
7035,"5 percent for a basket of long-term government issues from the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain and France",,
7035,"Emerging markets â€œare priced for deep disappointment,â€ù he said",,
7035, â€œAny upside surprise is not priced in,,
7035,â€ùFunds that invest in emerging stock markets did not disappoint in the first quarter,,
7035, The average one rose 11,,
7035,"9 percent, helping the average international stock fund to return 7",,
7035,9 percent,,
7035,Mr,,
7035, Gundlach prefers foreign markets for similar reasons,,
7035," He favors France, where returns have lagged those in other European countries, like Germany and Britain, over the last year",,
7035," A populist presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, has continued to poll well ahead of French elections that will begin next Sunday, although she is not expected to win",,
7035,"Among emerging markets, he considers India an excellent investment over the very long term",,
7035, He foresees its economy developing much as Chinaâ€™s has over the last few decades,,
7035,â€œWhen foreign markets outperform the U,,
7035,S,,
7035,", you see tremendous enthusiasm for U",,
7035,S,,

7036,"SAN TERENZIANO, Italy â€” On a May afternoon, when the weather was unable to decide between sun and showers, the dedication of pork lovers here in this central Italian town was sorely tested",,
7036," Again and again, rain arrived; the crowd scattered",,
7036,"But again and again, as the sun returned, they poured back into the town square, appetites renewed for more porchetta: the aromatic, ancient whole pig roast that a crowd of hundreds had gathered to celebrate",,
7036," It was the last day of Porchettiamo, a new festival devoted to porchetta, and a few showers were not going to keep them from the rare opportunity to taste a dozen different kinds of this beloved dish",,
7036,"To make porchetta, a whole pig is deboned and gutted, then stuffed with garlic and herbs, and roasted in its skin until crunchy, juicy and insanely aromatic",,
7036," (The head is left on, so when it is cooked, a whole porchetta looks like a pig in a brown sleeping bag",,
7036,")It is served sliced and stuffed into crusty rolls or between slabs of focaccia; because it is boneless, every slice has spirals of tender meat, lush fat and crunchy cracklings",,
7036," As at a whole-hog barbecue in the United States, the goal is a mix of all three in each bite",,
7036,"The dish is popular all over Italy as street food, almost always spotted at events like street fairs and weekly produce markets",,
7036," Multiple sagras, or food festivals, are devoted to it every year",,
7036, But Umbria fiercely guards its reputation as the birthplace of porchetta,,
7036,"It is a simple dish, not a professional butcherâ€™s masterpiece like the famous salamis from nearby Norcia, but it inspires great passions",,
7036," â€œThe idea came to me in a dream,â€ù said Anna Setteposte, a co-founder of the festival",,
7036," Its manifesto reads, â€œMore than a festival: a declaration of love",,
7036,"â€ùUnlike most sagras, Porchettiamo gathers multiple producers from all over Italy, enabling porchetta partisans to taste, compare and simply gorge",,
7036,"At one end of the festival, at the booth of Antica Salumeria Granieri Amato, founded in 1916, three generations of the Granieri family were handing children crunchy hunks of deeply bronzed skin",,
7036," Their salumeria produces a strictly traditional porchetta, and is one of the last to still roast porchetta in a wood oven, for smoky flavor",,
7036,"At the other end, the hip young chef Marco Gubbiotti of Cucinaa, a â€œgastronomic projectâ€ù in nearby Foligno, handed out porchetta sandwiches stuffed with a confit of apple and fennel",,
7036,"Some producers use fistfuls of garlic, others just pinches; some leave the liver in for the rich flavor it adds to the stuffing, others consider that bizarre; some perfume the meat with rosemary, while others maintain that only fennel pollen has the true flavor of Umbria",,
7036,The professional chefs used a large piece of pork that American butchers call the â€œperfect cutâ€ù instead of the whole pig,,
7036," â€œThey take the whole pork belly, which is super fatty, and wrap it around the loin, which is relatively lean,â€ù said Matt Lindemulder, a partner at Porchetta in the East Village, where they use the same cut",,
7036," â€œWhen they cook together, the fat from the belly bastes the loin",,
7036,"â€ùRespect for food traditions was already entrenched in Italian culture when the modern values of eating locally, sustainably and transparently went global â€” partly via Slow Food, which was founded just a few hundred kilometers away",,
7036," At Porchettiamo, the Umbrian reverence for pork, and passion for the deep culinary and agricultural heritage of the region, were on full display",,
7036,"Valentino Gerbi, a founder and butcher at a new meat producer called Etrusco, handed out juicy meatballs and fliers advertising the companyâ€™s â€œcarne locale radicale,â€ù radical local meat",,
7036,Etrusco allows its animals â€” both cows and pigs â€” to grow larger than modern tastes have dictated,,
7036," Todayâ€™s younger, smaller animals are more tender, but they are less flavorful, and less like the meat our great-grandparents ate",,
7036,"â€œWe embrace the peasant traditions of central Italy â€” no compromises, no shortcuts,â€ù Mr",,
7036, Gerbi said,,
7036,"Many other farmers here are developing sidelines in organic and heirloom produce, or converting family farms from commercial to traditional production",,
7036,"â€œLike the old times, our pigs are grazing outdoors, eating corn and barley instead of bone meal, taking no supplements or antibiotics,â€ù said Ramon Rustici, a farmer who supplied several of the pigs for Porchettiamo",,
7036," â€œPeople today want to know that they are eating cibo vero,â€ù real food",,
7036,"It doesnâ€™t get much more real than the back room of Carlo Giulianiâ€™s butcher shop in Costano just after dawn, when the smell of bleach is still stronger than the smell of blood",,
7036," The day after Porchettiamo, Mr",,
7036," Giuliani was preparing to make porchetta from a 220-pound pig that had been raised at the Rustici farm in the hills above Assisi, slaughtered and cleaned, then aged for three days to dry out the skin (this makes it crisp up when roasted)",,
7036,"Like many European farmers, the Rusticis raise Large Whites, a fast-growing, hardy breed of British origin; the Italian strain is bred with particularly large and muscular legs, the better for making prosciutto",,
7036,Mr,,
7036," Giuliani had no special tools, just a knowledge of porcine anatomy and a knife with a wickedly thin, long blade that he sharpened every 10 minutes or so",,
7036," (When knives are used to cut against bone, they dull very quickly",,
7036,")An hour later, he had removed more than 200 bones from the carcass; set aside the trotters and ears to simmer in a dish called cicotto that is made from the leftover bits of pig; and methodically rubbed the inside with minced shallots, garlic, salt, pepper and a thick golden dusting of fennel pollen",,
7036,"â€œThe fennel is what makes it Umbrian,â€ù said Barbara Dâ€™Agapiti, owner of Wine Link Italy, a guide to local food and wine",,
7036," Fennel grows wild here, and its pollen has the refreshing whiff of dried sage, with notes of saffron, lemon and fennel seed",,
7036,"To foreigners, Umbria and its food are often overshadowed by the high profile of Tuscany, which lies just to the west",,
7036," But in Italy, Umbria is fondly called â€œil cuore verde dâ€™Italia,â€ù the green heart of Italy, for its fertile soil and ancient agricultural traditions",,
7036, Pork from its green hills and deep forests has been prized since pre-Roman times,,
7036,"Today, if you spend time poking around Umbriaâ€™s pig farms, prosciutto makers and pork festivals, you will be regaled by theories about how the region came to be the epicenter of pork butchery in Italy",,
7036,"Among them: In Preci, Benedictine monks flourished as healers from the 13th century, building a rare library of anatomy texts and a renowned infirmary",,
7036, They taught their skills to locals who were already skilled in â€œsurgeryâ€ù â€” butchers,,
7036, Watching Mr,,
7036, Giuliani remove the pigâ€™s 32 ribs one by one lent credence to this theory,,
7036,"For those without surgical-level knife skills, Umbrian-style porchetta is still an accessible pleasure, within reach of any home cook with a large grill (though a roasting pan in an oven will do)",,
7036," Fennel pollen is easy to order and well worth trying, even if you believe that rosemary and garlic with pork is the most celestial combination imaginable",,
7036," (In California, where wild fennel does grow, cooks can easily harvest their own",,
7036,")A whole pig is not practical unless you are feeding a whole town, but any boneless well-marbled roast with skin or a thick fat cap will do",,
7036,"The key elements of the finished dish are juicy meat, soft fat and crispy crust",,
7036," In modern Umbrian kitchens, porchetta has expanded beyond pork, so that â€œin porchettaâ€ù has simply come to mean boneless meat, rolled round garlic and herbs, and roasted",,
7036,"It is served at hip Umbrian restaurants in variations like carp in porchetta, beef in porchetta, and â€” in the case of the young chef Nicolas Bonifacio of Eat Out Osteria Gourmet in Assisi â€” rabbit in porchetta with hummus, garlic yogurt and Middle Eastern spices",,
7036,"Porchetta, the festival organizers say, deserved to be honored as food of the people, unlike luxury ingredients such as truffles, prosciutto and Parmigiano-Reggiano that typically command respect and attention from the greater food world",,
7036,"â€œStreet food is the food of the future,â€ù said Antonio Boco, a co-founder of Porchettiamo",,

7038,"MUNICH â€” With time running short for Greece to meet a deadline to stay in the eurozone, a small but influential circle of debt experts are putting forward a provocative plan to persuade foreign investors to lend Greece the money it needs to survive",,
7038,The proposal aims to make private sector bond investors â€” not governments and international lenders â€” the primary creditors when it comes to doling out money to Greece,,
7038,Doing so would help overcome what many economists see as the central obstacle preventing Greece from reaching a deal with its creditors,,
7038," More than 90 percent of Greeceâ€™s 310 billion euro debt is owed to public institutions: other European governments, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank",,
7038,The proposal is being advanced by Mitu Gulati and Lee C,,
7038," Buchheit, two well-known debt lawyers who played a central role in the restructuring of Greeceâ€™s debt in 2012",,
7038,Just two days remain before European leaders meet on Sunday to debate whether Greece stays in or leaves the eurozone,,
7038," On Thursday, the Greek government submitted a revised list of economic reforms to its creditors in the hope of unlocking fresh funds",,
7038,It is unlikely that Mr,,
7038, Gulati and Mr,,
7038, Buchheitâ€™s proposal will be accepted as an immediate solution to address the countryâ€™s cash crisis,,
7038," Yet there is a growing sense among Greek and German government officials that the two countries, having come closer to an exit plan than either side expected, will reach an accord on Sunday",,
7038,"For that to happen, Germany needs to give Greece a strong signal that some debt relief will be coming",,
7038, And Greece needs to convince its creditors that it is addressing address crucial areas like taxes and pensions,,
7038,"â€œI think there will be a deal on Sunday,â€ù said Hans-Werner Sinn, an economist based in Munich who has long advocated that Greece leave the euro",,
7038,Mr,,
7038, Sinn noted that France was pushing hard to keep Greece inside the eurozone and that Germany would not risk alienating France over the question of Greece,,
7038,"While such an agreement would prevent the immediate dislocation of an unruly Greek exit, it would not address the more complex problem of Greeceâ€™s continued dependence on public sector loans to fund its day-to-day operations",,
7038,That is where the proposal put forward by Mr,,
7038, Gulati and Mr,,
7038, Buchheit would come in,,
7038," They see their plan as a way for Greece to gain access to new money and for Europe to avoid more extreme options, like writing down the countryâ€™s debt",,
7038,"â€œThe question really has to be how do we get the private sector back into the game,â€ù said Mr",,
7038," Gulati, who presented the proposal at a conference on Greek debt held here on Wednesday and Thursday",,
7038,"European governments do not want to lend Greece any more money, nor do they want to have their debts written down, Mr",,
7038, Gulati said,,
7038," So the trick, he argued, is devising a mechanism that can persuade private sector investors to pick up the slack",,
7038,"Since the onset of the European debt crisis in 2010, Mr",,
7038," Gulati, a law professor at Duke University, and Mr",,
7038," Buchheit, a prominent sovereign debt lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, have floated numerous ideas about how Europe should deal with Greeceâ€™s debt",,
7038,Some of their proposals have had a direct impact on policy,,
7038, The best known was a brief they wrote in 2010 that would become the framework for Greeceâ€™s landmark debt restructuring in 2012,,
7038,Other trial balloons have been politely dismissed,,
7038,"In the last week, the two men have pitched their initiative to senior economic officials in the Dutch and German governments",,
7038, They plan to write a formal paper laying out their proposal in more detail in the coming weeks,,
7038,They have also emphasized that the plan should not be seen as a way to avoid cutting Greece some slack on its debt,,
7038,"â€œThis is not a substitute for debt relief,â€ù Mr",,
7038, Buchheit said,,
7038," Nor, he added, should it be seen as a way for Greece to escape the tough reforms it needs to put in place to make the economy more functional and efficient",,
7038,"Still, they say, private sector bond investors should be granted a powerful incentive to load up on risky Greek debt by being awarded seniority over public sector debt holders",,
7038,"That means these nongovernment lenders would jump to the head of the line of creditors in terms of who gets paid first if, in the future, Greece does not have enough money to pay all of its lenders",,
7038,"If the plan is successful, the thinking goes, it will be the global debt market â€” hedge funds and mutual funds â€” not the German government or the I",,
7038,M,,
7038,F,,
7038,", that decides whether Greece should be able to borrow more money",,
7038, Most other sovereign governments go to the debt markets to raise money to fund their operations,,
7038,"Because European taxpayers are liable when it comes to Greek debt, the negotiations of the last six months have been driven more by politics than economics",,
7038," Germany, the Netherlands and even smaller nations like Malta and Estonia have said that Greece should not be allowed to borrow any more money",,
7038,"It would be more sensible, the two men argue, if European governments agreed to grant seniority to private sector bond investors",,
7038," Long-term institutional bond investors would thus have a good reason to invest in Greece, even with its daunting debt ratio of 175 percent of gross domestic product",,
7038,That is because they would be paid before European governments in the event of a total default,,
7038,"It is not unusual in crisis situations for government lenders to agree to have their loans demoted to avert a larger crisis and attract private investors, Mr",,
7038, Gulati said,,
7038,"Still, it is unclear whether European governments would agree to do this",,
7038," When a sovereign government is close to default, being a senior creditor is a treasured status that is not casually bargained away",,
7038,It is also true that in the wake of the I,,
7038,M,,
7038,F,,
7038,"â€™s call for a debt restructuring in Greece, this approach could be criticized as dancing away from the core issue, which is that, once and for all, Europeans must accept losses on their debt positions",,
7038,"â€œThe time has finally come for a write-down of Greek debt,â€ù Ashoka Mody, a former I",,
7038,M,,
7038,F,,
7038," economist who oversaw the fundâ€™s bailout of Ireland, said at the conference",,
7038,"But if the choice comes to having to take a loss on your loans or lending even more money to Greece, ceding your most-preferred-lender status may well be seen as the least painful option",,

7039,"â€œFinma concluded that the individuals in question were directly responsible for the serious breaches of regulation at UBS in this business,â€ù it said in a news release",,
7039,"The regulator said its investigation had determined that those responsible for management of foreign currency trading at UBS â€œtolerated, and at times encouraged, behavior which was improper and against the interests of clients",,
7039,"â€ùManagers, the regulator said, were aware that traders were able to use group chats to share information and the potential risk of doing so, but failed to implement adequate systems and controls and to consistently monitor them for compliance with internal and external rules",,
7039,"The regulator said traders shared confidential client information, sometimes revealed the identity of clients to third parties and traded ahead of client orders in a practice known as front-running",,

7040," Most Catholic colleges de-emphasized the sport because it was expensive,  adopting basketball instead",,
7040," This distinction helps explain Notre Dameâ€™s eclectic scheduling, as several nearby teams refused to play it",,
7040, The university also doubled down on football to promote Catholic assimilation in the Protestant-dominated culture,,
7040,"â€œIt was about wholesome activities,â€ù Fisher said",,
7040, â€œFootball was tailor-made for this all-American display of Catholic Americanism,,
7040,"â€ùHad Notre Dame been founded by Protestants, it could never have distinguished itself on the gridiron this way",,
7040," Instead, as Americaâ€™s Catholic team, it monopolized Catholic football players nationally",,
7040," There is a lengthy chicken-or-egg debate to be had about Notre Dameâ€™s football success and interest in football among the offspring of Italian, Polish and Irish immigrants",,
7040,"â€œThere was a good line: â€˜Notre Dame doesnâ€™t recruit, it gathers,â€™â€ù Oriard said",,
7040, â€œIt could have the pick of the best Catholic high school football players everywhere in the country,,
7040,â€ùIts uniquely nongeographic fan base also made Notre Dame an obvious choice for national television rebroadcasts starting in the 1950s,,
7040, Notre Dame quickly grew into the countryâ€™s most prominent (and perhaps most polarizing) team,,
7040,"While Notre Dameâ€™s glory years were the â€™20s through the â€™40s, all these characteristics kept it competitive when college footballâ€™s center of gravity swung from the Northeast and Midwest toward the Plains and the South",,
7040, The Irish split the 1966 national championship and won two more in the â€™70s,,
7040,And then everything about college football changed,,
7040, Notre Dameâ€™s status as a national team had been a historical accident,,
7040, Its success today is a product of its deliberately becoming the apotheosis of its former self,,
7040,"Today, Notre Dame barnstorms relentlessly",,
7040, Its five-games-a-season deal with the Atlantic Coast Conference provides a steady stream of games in the recruiting-rich Mid-Atlantic and South,,

7040," Notre Dame has remained leagueless, allowing it to sign its own television deal, with NBC",,
7040," That, Swarbrick said, â€œallows all our home games to be broadcast on a national basis, not regionalized",,
7040,â€ùNotre Dame also tries to peddle academic excellence,,
7040, It sacrifices some players bound for the Alabamas and Ohio States â€” whom it most likely was not getting anyway â€” but gains a distinguishing selling point,,

7040, This seasonâ€™s roster has players from 28 states and the District of Columbia,,
7040,"In short, Notre Dame has remained competitive",,
7040," But competitive enough? Since nearly winning a championship in 1993, this is only the second time the Irish have contended seriously for a national title",,
7040,"In 2012, Notre Dameâ€™s idiosyncratic schedule helped it go undefeated",,
7040," Its opponents had down years, and it landed in the national championship game opposite a one-loss Alabama team that was favored by more than a touchdown â€” and ended up winning by four, 42-14",,

7042," As the manager of the Kansas City Royals, he had a formidable bullpen at his disposal",,
7042," Kelvin Herrera, who throws 99 m",,
7042,p,,
7042,h,,
7042,", had already pitched the seventh inning, his usual assignment",,
7042, He struck out all three batters he faced,,
7042," Wade Davis, the master of a near-unhittable cut fastball, had done his job by pitching a scoreless eighth",,
7042," That left Greg Holland, who has saved 116 games for the Royals over the past three seasons",,
7042," Hollandâ€™s responsibility, as Yost saw it, was to finish games â€” but only when protecting a lead",,
7042, Yost said repeatedly that he wouldnâ€™t use Holland when his team is behind or tied,,
7042," â€˜â€˜Donâ€™t look for me to do it,â€™â€™ he told the beat writers after one game last year",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Iâ€™m not going to do it,,
7042,"â€™â€™Now Yost brought in Ryan Madson, a hard-throwing journeyman who had been with four clubs in four years",,
7042," The first batter he faced, JosÃ© Iglesias, led off the inning with a single",,
7042," The second, Ian Kinsler, smacked a fastball over the left-field wall",,
7042," Quick as that, the Royals were losers",,
7042,The early-August game was hardly pivotal,,
7042," Kansas City, which enters the playoffs this week, had a commanding lead in its division",,
7042," But Yostâ€™s use of Madson â€” really, his refusal to use Holland or to let Herrera or Davis pitch more than one inning â€” represents the intransigence that for years has exasperated those who watch him manage",,
7042,"To many, Yost is a holdover from baseballâ€™s Dark Ages, when managers followed their guts on tactical decisions, the way they might play a late-night game of Monopoly",,
7042," Suspicion of anything even marginally unconventional or innovative, let alone intellectual, was woven into the fabric of the sport",,
7042, Players were judged by looks almost as much as by performance,,
7042,The correction has been thorough,,
7042," In recent years, the ability to track, accumulate and analyze data has affected the way teams scout prospects, position their fielders and make nearly every other decision on how they play the game",,
7042," More than a few now operate strictly by the numbers, guided by staff mathematicians who barely watch the games, so as to not be overly influenced by appearances",,
7042," Analytical commentators and other observers, armed with formulas and metrics, crunch the numbers involved in Yostâ€™s decisions and conclude that many of them are simply wrong",,
7042,"Mitchel Lichtman, an author and a former professional gambler who has consulted for the Cardinals and Astros (coincidentally, the F",,
7042,B,,
7042,I,,
7042," is investigating the former for hacking the latterâ€™s database and stealing information), says that the statistics are unambiguous: not bringing Holland into a situation like that of the Detroit game is bad managing",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s a mistake,â€™â€™ he insisted to me",,
7042," Lichtman is vexed by the decisions managers make in almost every game he watches, but he feels particular disdain for Yost",,
7042, He explained away Yostâ€™s success with the Royals by saying: â€˜â€˜Thereâ€™s so much luck involved in short-term success,,
7042, Even a ,,
7042,"500 team, I could show you very easily, can win 90 games and then 12 or 15 in the playoffs on luck",,
7042,â€™â€™Lichtmanâ€™s is just one voice in a loud chorus,,
7042," Because of Yostâ€™s apparent obliviousness to data-based thinking, he has become the most criticized manager in baseball",,
7042, The reach of social media and the herd mentality that pervades it may make him the most criticized manager ever,,
7042," The criticism occurs not merely at the margins, in bars and man caves and on Twitter and fan websites (where the verb â€˜â€˜Yostedâ€™â€™ has emerged to describe what happens when his choices lead to a Royals loss), but squarely in the media mainstream",,
7042," It fixates on Yostâ€™s batting orders, his teamâ€™s tendency to bunt and steal, the way he handles his pitching â€” nearly everything that can be plugged into a formula and rendered as a number",,
7042, The Chicago Tribune has suggested that Yost is â€˜â€˜a bumbling idiot,,
7042,â€™â€™ A Wall Street Journal headline referred to him as a â€˜â€˜dunce,,
7042,"â€™â€™ Pedro Martinez, a Hall of Fame pitcher and TV commentator, disparaged one of his decisions in the playoffs last year as â€˜â€˜another panic move",,
7042,â€™â€™Yet Yost keeps winning,,
7042," Last fall, after sweeping their first eight playoff games, the Royals pushed the San Francisco Giants to the final inning of the seventh game of the World Series",,
7042," During the off-season, his best starting pitcher, James Shields, and his starting right fielder and designated hitter departed for other teams â€” and still Yost led the Royals to their first division title since 1985",,
7042," Despite inconsistent starting pitching and a ligament injury that recently ended Hollandâ€™s season, they begin the playoffs in position to reach the World Series for a second consecutive year, something the team has never accomplished in its 47-season history",,
7042,"Yost, who is 61, has managed the Royals since 2010",,
7042," Before that, he managed Milwaukee from 2003 to 2008",,
7042," Since joining the Brewers, he has presided over just five winning seasons, including 2015, and was fired during one of them before it ended",,
7042," But he also transformed perennial losers, from baseballâ€™s smallest two markets, into contenders",,
7042," â€˜â€˜He took a franchise that had not been to the playoffs in 25 years, built it up and got it to the playoffs,â€™â€™ Doug Melvin, the executive who hired and fired Yost in Milwaukee, told me this summer",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Then he took a franchise in Kansas City that hadnâ€™t been to the playoffs in 30 years and did the same thing,,
7042, I donâ€™t care what anyone says about him,,
7042," How many managers have done that?â€™â€™Ruddy-faced and taciturn, Yost looks like a baseball manager from a less image-conscious era, someone who might spend the game with tobacco juice dribbling down his chin",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Heâ€™s not reading psychology books,â€™â€™ says Jonah Keri, a writer for Grantland",,
7042," One manager who actually does read them, the Cubsâ€™ Joe Maddon, is widely considered baseballâ€™s best",,
7042, Maddon wears hip black-rimmed glasses and collects wine,,
7042," The Yankeesâ€™ Joe Girardi, engaging and articulate, has an engineering degree from Northwestern, which presumably helps him interpret the mathematics used to capture whatâ€™s happening on the field",,
7042," Brad Ausmus, who has managed the Tigers the last two seasons, studied government at Dartmouth",,
7042,Yost grew up in Californiaâ€™s Livermore Valley as an undersize striver seeking a sport in which he could excel,,
7042," Cut from the high-school soccer team, he struggled for a semester as a 5-foot- 2 hurdler",,
7042," Then he turned to baseball, which he hadnâ€™t played since Little League",,
7042, In 36 J,,
7042,V,,
7042," at-bats as a sophomore, he couldnâ€™t muster a hit",,
7042," Nevertheless, Yost decided he was going to play â€” not merely in high school, but for a living",,
7042," â€˜â€˜I just knew it,â€™â€™ he says",,
7042," â€˜â€˜When I sat down with my counselors and they said, â€˜What are you going to do?â€™ I said, â€˜Iâ€™m going to be a professional baseball player",,
7042,â€™ And they looked at me like I was nuts,,
7042,"â€™â€™Such certitude, based on no discernible foundation, has informed Yostâ€™s decision-making processes all his life",,
7042," â€˜â€˜I often wonder, Do other people have that same feeling and then it doesnâ€™t happen?â€™â€™ Yost told me",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Because I knew it was going to happen,,
7042,"â€™â€™ He made varsity, had a growth spurt, then landed at Chabot College",,
7042," After he starred on a summer team, the Mets drafted him as a catcher",,
7042," In 1980, he reached the majors, just as he had predicted",,
7042," He seldom played, though",,
7042," Over six seasons, Yost accumulated just 605 at-bats, a number that starters can exceed in a single year",,
7042," He was wondering what to do next when the Braves asked if he would work with young players at their minor-league outpost in Sumter, S",,
7042,C,,
7042," He ended up as the manager there for three years before being hired onto Bobby Coxâ€™s staff in Atlanta, where he remained for more than a decade as a bullpen coach and later a third-base coach",,
7042,"Along the way, he cultivated an unconventional relationship with players, one that made them eager to get to the ballpark",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Heâ€™d throw a belt into the whirlpool when I was in there and pretend it was a snake,â€™â€™ recalls Eddie Perez, who was in Sumter and Atlanta with Yost",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Not many managers would do that,,
7042,â€™â€™Yost can be prickly in news conferences,,
7042," But in an intimate setting, heâ€™s engaging, even warm",,
7042," One afternoon this summer, he shared memories with me about a friend he considered a mentor, the car racer Dale Earnhardt, whom he met through a common friend in the early 1990s",,
7042, Yost wears his No,,
7042," 3 to honor Earnhardt, who died in a crash in 2001",,
7042," â€˜â€˜We hit it off,â€™â€™ he said",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Hunted together every year,,
7042,"â€™â€™ In 1994, when a labor dispute truncated the baseball season, Earnhardt invited Yost to travel with him on the Nascar circuit and serve as â€˜â€˜rehydration engineerâ€™â€™ (in other words, water-fetcher)",,
7042," At one race, Earnhardt roared back from a huge deficit and nearly won",,
7042," When Yost congratulated him, Earnhardt grabbed him by the shirt and pulled his friend nose to nose",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Never, ever, let anybody who youâ€™re around, anybody youâ€™re associated with, allow you to settle for mediocrity,â€™â€™ Yost says Earnhardt told him",,
7042,"Later, Yost would be criticized for not replacing erratic infielders when he had late-inning leads and allowing untested pitchers to compete â€” and often fail â€” in crucial situations",,
7042," The critics didnâ€™t understand, he told me, that he wasnâ€™t necessarily trying to win those games",,
7042," â€˜â€˜The difference between 72 and 76 wins doesnâ€™t mean a damn thing to me,â€™â€™ he says",,
7042," It was the same as the difference between second place and last place, which, Earnhardt had stressed, was no difference at all",,
7042,"â€˜â€˜I wanted to put those young players in a position to gain experience, so that when we could compete for a championship, theyâ€™d know how,â€™â€™ Yost says",,
7042, â€˜â€˜You canâ€™t do that when youâ€™re pinch-hitting for young guys,,
7042, You canâ€™t do it when you quick-hook starting pitchers,,
7042, Theyâ€™ll never learn to work themselves out of trouble,,
7042," People would say, â€˜Whatâ€™s he doing?â€™ They didnâ€™t understand",,
7042, Iâ€™d rather lose a game on my watch so they could win later,,
7042,"â€™â€™In Milwaukee, Yost was hired by Doug Melvin to nurture a group of young players learning to be major leaguers",,
7042," He inherited a 56-win team, the worst in franchise history, and a legacy that was equally dismal: The Brewers hadnâ€™t fielded a winning team in more than a decade",,
7042," In their first two seasons under Yost, they won just 68 and 67 games",,
7042," But in 2007, they remained in contention until the seasonâ€™s final week before finishing 83-79, narrowly missing the playoffs",,
7042," That week, an increasingly agitated Yost was ejected from games three times for arguing with umpires",,
7042, The consensus was that heâ€™d cracked under the pressure,,
7042,"The next year, the Brewers were 16 games above ",,
7042,"500 with two weeks remaining in the season, but they were in a terrible slump, having lost 11 of 16 games and prompting talk of another collapse",,
7042, Yost was fired,,
7042, The Brewers wound up winning 90 games but would be remembered as the playoff team that dumped its manager down the stretch,,
7042,"The knock on Yost as an unsteady hand returned last fall, after the Royals qualified as one of the two American League wild-card teams",,
7042," In the elimination game against Oakland, Shields held a 3-2 lead after five innings",,
7042, Then he allowed a single and a walk to start the sixth,,
7042," Yost had Herrera, Davis and Holland, but as usual they were earmarked for the seventh, eighth and ninth",,
7042," Instead, he turned to Yordano Ventura, a 23-year-old starter who worked as a reliever once all season and threw 73 pitches two days before",,
7042,"â€˜â€˜The conventional way is to bring in Herrera early,â€™â€™ says outfielder Jonny Gomes, who was playing for Oakland at the time",,
7042, â€˜â€˜He did it a different way,,
7042," He had a young guy come in with tons of emotion, which young guys typically canâ€™t control",,
7042," Knowing that, our approach was patience",,
7042,"â€™â€™The criticism of Yost, on television and online, began when he lifted Shields",,
7042," Then Brandon Moss hit a three-run homer, giving Oakland the lead",,
7042," When Yost left the dugout to replace Ventura, the reaction from the home fans was hostile, bordering on homicidal",,
7042," For 29 years, they had longed for the playoffs",,
7042," Now, it appeared, the obduracy of an already unpopular manager was ending the Royalsâ€™ postseason before it had barely begun",,
7042, Their frustration manifested itself in a deafening outpouring of disapproval,,
7042," â€˜â€˜Iâ€™d never in my life heard anything like it,â€™â€™ says the broadcaster Ryan Lefebvre, whose father, Jim, played and managed in the major leagues",,
7042,"â€˜â€˜It didnâ€™t bother me,â€™â€™ Yost told me",,
7042, â€˜â€˜I still felt like we were going to win the game,,
7042, I had no doubt that we would,,
7042,"â€™â€™ They did, in 12 innings",,
7042, Then they swept their series against the Angels and the Orioles,,
7042,Yost arrived in Kansas City in 2010 with the mandate to develop young talent as he did in Milwaukee,,
7042," Dayton Moore, the Royalsâ€™ general manager, worked with Yost in Atlanta",,
7042, He dismisses the end of Yostâ€™s tenure with the Brewers as irrelevant,,
7042," â€˜â€˜Thereâ€™s so much more to managing a baseball team than whatâ€™s happening on the field,â€™â€™ Moore says",,
7042," When the Royalsâ€™ losses mounted, Moore didnâ€™t flinch",,
7042," â€˜â€˜A lot of people were saying we needed to make a change,â€™â€™ he says",,
7042, â€˜â€˜It never crossed my mind,,
7042,â€™â€™Moore had spent enough time in the clubhouse to notice how Yost and his charges interacted,,
7042," Yost, it turned out, had hardly changed since Sumter",,
7042," Instead of data points to be plugged into an equation, he treated players with sportive affection, like favored nephews",,
7042," â€˜â€˜I love these guys,â€™â€™ Yost told me",,
7042, â€˜â€˜I really love them,,
7042," You have to, in order to understand them",,
7042, And you have to understand them in order to manage them,,
7042," If you understand their backgrounds, why they are the way they are, you can understand what motivates them",,
7042,"â€™â€™Like most modern clubhouses, Kansas Cityâ€™s is an eclectic mix",,
7042, Chris Young is a cerebral Princeton graduate,,
7042, Lorenzo Cain was raised by his mother in rural Florida and didnâ€™t play baseball until high school,,
7042, Drew Buteraâ€™s father and Mike Moustakasâ€™s uncle were major leaguers,,
7042," There are Dominicans and Venezuelans, a Puerto Rican, a Nicaraguan, a Cuban and sometimes even a Brazilian",,
7042," â€˜â€˜This is a very culturally diverse team,â€™â€™ says Ben Zobrist, a utility player who was traded to Kansas City from Oakland in July",,
7042, â€˜â€˜But these guys for sure feel comfortable with each other,,
7042," When a clubhouse is that comfortable, it has started with the manager",,
7042,"â€™â€™To Zobrist, an ideal clubhouse is one where you canâ€™t tell whether a team has lost or won four games in a row",,
7042," Thatâ€™s possible because of the steady, accretive cadence of baseball, a sport in which alternating games of no hits and three hits will win you a batting title",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Most managers donâ€™t let you do it,â€™â€™ he says",,
7042, â€˜â€˜You pick up clues from the manager,,
7042," If heâ€™s worried, you need to be worried",,
7042," Here, you have the freedom to think that whatever happened yesterday doesnâ€™t matter",,
7042,â€™â€™The Royalsâ€™ success isnâ€™t all about intangibles,,
7042, A decade of high draft picks has paid off with a cadre of homegrown stars,,
7042, And Moore has constructed a roster of line-drive hitters and fleet fielders tailored to the capacious dimensions of Kansas Cityâ€™s Kauffman Stadium,,
7042, Itâ€™s also ideally suited for the economics of playing in the sportâ€™s second-smallest metropolitan area: Building a team around outfield defense and middle relief is cheap compared with the marquee expenses of power hitting and starting pitching,,
7042,"Still, itâ€™s telling that castoffs and prospects on downward trajectories have, one after another, righted themselves under Yost",,
7042," The Royalsâ€™ burly third baseman, Mike Moustakas, the second pick in the amateur draft, who had been successful at every minor-league level, was struggling last season, his batting average lower than his weight",,
7042, â€˜â€˜I kept hearing: â€˜Why are you playing him? Why are you playing him?â€™â€‰â€™â€™ Yost says,,
7042, Moustakas would arrive each day wondering if heâ€™d be dropped from the lineup,,
7042," Finally, it dawned on him that no matter how badly he performed, Yost wasnâ€™t going to remove him",,
7042, The effect was liberating,,
7042, His five postseason homers led the team,,
7042,"â€˜â€˜He finds a way to get each of us to believe in what heâ€™s doing,â€™â€™ Moustakas says",,
7042," â€˜â€˜For me, it really helped to get out there, struggle and learn how to work through failure",,
7042, It made all the difference,,
7042,"â€™â€™ This year, Moustakas was named an American League All-Star",,
7042," When Yost made the announcement, he beamed like a proud uncle",,
7042,"One night this season, Yost encountered a knot of players leaving the team hotel in Milwaukee",,
7042, It was nearly 10,,
7042," Hearing that they were headed to a late dinner and then a casino, he nodded",,
7042," He wasnâ€™t giving his blessing, exactly, but he wasnâ€™t disapproving either",,
7042," â€˜â€˜I know these guys inside and out,â€™â€™ he told me later",,
7042, â€˜â€˜I know they wonâ€™t stay out too long,,
7042, Their goal is winning,,
7042, They wonâ€™t do anything to detract from that,,
7042,"â€™â€™Such trust â€” or naÃ¯vetÃ©, as some would call it â€” informs Yostâ€™s relations with his team",,
7042," Heâ€™s criticized because his players bunt and steal excessively, risking outs in a misguided attempt to move runners up a base",,
7042," Statistics indicate that this strategy, depending on the situation, can decrease the likelihood that the Royals will score multiple runs that inning",,
7042," But most of those decisions, it turns out, arenâ€™t made by Yost",,
7042," Perhaps alone among big-league managers, he allows his players to run and bunt on their own",,
7042," The few games that such ill-considered tactics might cost during a season, he has decided, are more than mitigated by a lack of inhibition that will encourage looser, more productive play",,
7042," â€˜â€˜He allows us to be ourselves, on and off the field,â€™â€™ says Lorenzo Cain, the center fielder",,
7042, â€˜â€˜And we have a blast doing it,,
7042," We laugh together, have a great time",,
7042, The chemistry on this team is amazing,,
7042, That reflects on a manager,,
7042, And it matters,,
7042,â€™â€™That chemistry appears to have offset the construction of curious batting orders,,
7042," Alcides Escobar, who has hit leadoff for much of the season, historically reaches base less often than the league average",,
7042, The potent Alex Gordon was hitting sixth before he strained a groin muscle in early July,,
7042, This in particular rankles the analysts,,
7042," â€˜â€˜Batting order is something a manager very clearly has control of,â€™â€™ says Dave Cameron, the managing editor of the widely read website FanGraphs",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s something Yost has done particularly poorly,,
7042,"â€™â€™Yost dismisses such criticism, but others in the organization feel compelled to respond",,
7042," â€˜â€˜We have information that the fans and analysts donâ€™t,â€™â€™ says Yostâ€™s bench coach, Don Wakamatsu, who previously managed the Seattle Mariners",,
7042," There, Wakamatsu says, he occasionally put the slugger Russell Branyan at No",,
7042," 4, the cleanup spot",,
7042," â€˜â€˜When I did, heâ€™d break out in hives",,
7042," But Iâ€™d put him at 2 or 5 or 6, and he was a worldbeater",,
7042," Can the numbers account for that?â€™â€™If anyone can make them do so, it is Grantlandâ€™s Keri, perhaps the most thoughtful of the analytical commentators",,
7042," When we met for lunch near his home in Denver this summer, the Royals â€” whom he ranked 23rd out of 30 teams before the season â€” were in the midst of another streak",,
7042," They had won seven of eight and were distancing themselves from the rest of the division, dominance that neither he nor any of the other experts had predicted",,
7042," â€˜â€˜They have a defense-oriented, run-prevention team,â€™â€™ he explained",,
7042," â€˜â€˜And when you have close games, weird things can happen",,
7042,â€™â€™Keri wrote a book about the Tampa Bay Rays when Maddon was the teamâ€™s manager,,
7042," Against all odds, Maddon took that frugal, data-centric team to the World Series",,
7042," Its success, Keri wrote, was predicated on Maddonâ€™s willingness to be guided by the advanced analytics compiled by the Raysâ€™ braintrust",,
7042," As we talked, Keri offhandedly explained that Maddon has an advantage over other number-crunchers",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Heâ€™s a charmer,â€™â€™ he said",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s pretty clear that the best thing he does is, heâ€™s a likable guy",,
7042, He gets players to like him and play for him,,
7042,"â€™â€™The way he described the sportâ€™s most respected manager sounded a lot like its least respected manager, I pointed out",,
7042, Yost gave the Royals confidence in their abilities and the freedom to play with enthusiasm,,
7042," His optimism might be goofy, I admitted, but it was infectious",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Then it turns out theyâ€™re pretty similar,â€™â€™ Keri considered",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Because itâ€™s all really about empowering your players and creating a comfortable environment for them to thrive,,
7042,"â€™â€™â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s strange,â€™â€™ he said, still musing as we were leaving",,
7042, â€˜â€˜They actually do a lot of the same things,,
7042,"â€™â€™If Yost never wavered in support of Moustakas, Cain, Escobar and others, it was because he saw their future, just as heâ€™d seen his own",,
7042," â€˜â€˜I knew it when I saw them playing as Class A ballplayers, that theyâ€™d be All-Stars,â€™â€™ he says",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Iâ€™ve never really had a guy that I strongly believed in not make it,,
7042," I just knew it, donâ€™t ask me how",,
7042,â€™â€™Last yearâ€™s Royals were foundering at the All-Star break,,
7042," â€˜â€˜Then we were swept by Boston,â€™â€™ Wakamatsu says",,
7042, â€˜â€˜Ned told us: â€˜Donâ€™t worry,,
7042, Weâ€™ll be 10 games over ,,
7042,500 soon,,
7042,"â€™ And we said, â€˜What?â€™ And we were",,
7042," And then he said, â€˜Weâ€™ll be 20 games over",,
7042,â€™ And we were,,
7042, Thereâ€™s a calmness and a confidence about it that eventually makes you not question it,,
7042,"â€™â€™Was Yost such an incisive judge of talent that he correctly identified a lineupâ€™s worth of future stars, or did his belief in them help make them that way? Did he see something in his team last year that others didnâ€™t, or did his confidence provide inspiration? These are questions, Iâ€™m sure, that analytics arenâ€™t meant to answer",,
7042,Yet the same unpredictability that confounds those who try to explain the game through statistical formulations is what makes it so enjoyable to follow,,
7042," Accumulated data might suggest shifting the shortstop to the other side of second base against a particular hitter, and that hitter might oblige by hitting a ground ball to exactly that spot",,
7042, The strategy has worked â€” except when the grounder hits a pebble and bounds past,,
7042," And thereâ€™s the batter, safe at first base",,
7042,"And thereâ€™s Yost, standing by the rail in the Royalsâ€™ dugout, leading his team into the playoffs, again, for reasons that seem impossible to quantify",,
7042," It isnâ€™t important to him why the grounders keep getting past the shortstop, only that they do",,
7042," â€˜â€˜Iâ€™ve been known as a dope my whole life,â€™â€™ he told me",,
7042, â€˜â€˜And I took a team to the World Series that hadnâ€™t been to the playoffs in 29 years,,
7042, And now everyone knows them,,
7042, And Iâ€™m still a big dope,,
7042, But it doesnâ€™t matter,,

7049,"In June, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri asked voters at a big political dinner to stand up if they had a pre-existing health condition",,
7049,Sheâ€™d been hearing from voters at town hall meetings that they were worried about health care,,
7049," â€œI just thought of it frankly at the podium,â€ù she said",,
7049, â€œI was just betting this is not that different from my town halls,,
7049,â€ùThe room was suddenly filled with standing voters,,
7049," â€œEven I was stunned just how few people kept their seats,â€ù she said",,
7049,"Now, Ms",,
7049, McCaskill asks the question at every event,,
7049," A few weeks ago, she mentioned the experience to her colleague Joe Donnelly of Indiana, another Democratic senator in a close race for re-election this year",,
7049," His version â€” asking coal workers at a Boonville, Ind",,
7049,", rally how many knew someone with a pre-existing condition â€” â€œreally moved me,â€ù Mr",,
7049, Donnelly said,,
7049," It has become a staple of his campaign events, too",,
7049,"After nearly a decade of playing defense on the issue, Democratic congressional candidates around the country are putting a health care message at the center of their campaigns",,
7049," After the Republicansâ€™ failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Democrats have detected a newfound concern that the consumer protections established under the law might go away",,
7049, And that fear has turned into a potent campaign theme,,
7049,"More than a quarter of working-age adults have a pre-existing health condition, like asthma, diabetes or cancer, that might have locked them out of the insurance market in the years before Obamacare, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation",,
7049, Surveys show that far more have a friend or family member with a serious medical problem,,
7049," Because health problems tend to pile up as people age, the older voters who tend to turn out most reliably in midterm elections experience such worry disproportionately",,
7049,"â€œI completely can see why theyâ€™re excited to be able to talk about this issue again,â€ù said Mollyann Brodie, a senior vice president at Kaiser, who runs the groupâ€™s public opinion polling",,
7049," The foundationâ€™s most recent survey, released last week, found that pre-existing conditions had become the most important health care concern among voters, ranked the most important campaign issue for many of them over all",,
7049," â€œI agree with the strategy, based on our polling and everyone elseâ€™s polling",,
7049, Itâ€™s a time when it is going to work,,
7049,â€ùItâ€™s not just red-state Democratic senators who are focusing on pre-existing conditions,,
7049, The issue is coming up in House races across the country,,
7049," Tyler Law, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, ticked off districts â€” in Arkansas, Washington, New Jersey â€” where itâ€™s a major campaign theme",,
7049," In markets with close races, the committee is running its own advertisements on health care",,
7049,"â€œWeâ€™re seeing candidates in every single district talking about health care,â€ù he said",,
7049, â€œThere is nowhere this does not play,,
7049,"â€ùTJ Cox, a candidate in Californiaâ€™s 21st District, in the stateâ€™s Central Valley, said the issue was personal to him",,
7049," He remembers being pulled aside by a hospital employee while his wife was in labor and told that her C-section would not be covered by his insurance, because she was pregnant when he bought the policy",,
7049," Fortunately for him, his wife, a physician, had her own coverage",,
7049,"He also hears about the issue from voters, including one who recently told him about the high cost of medications for hepatitis C, which the man could afford only with the help of insurance",,
7049," â€œHe was saying literally, â€˜Iâ€™m glad I got sick now, because before I donâ€™t know what I would have done,â€™ â€ù Mr",,
7049, Cox said,,
7049, â€œHe was uninsurable,,
7049,â€ùAnalysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data by the Wesleyan Media Project found that health care was by far the most common subject of Democratic campaign television ads,,
7049, The researchersâ€™ own description suggests the scale of the reversal,,
7049, â€œAn astounding 63 percent of pro-Democratic ads for U,,
7049,S,,
7049," House discuss health care, and 16 percent contain an explicit statement about being in favor of the Affordable Care Act,â€ù it said in a report published Wednesday",,
7049," In Senate races, a smaller fraction of pro-Democratic ads mentioned health care, 28 percent, but that was still more than any other subject",,
7049,The new emphasis on the issue stands in contrast with Democratic campaign themes of the last four election cycles,,
7049," In those races, it was Republicans who were using health care as their rallying cry",,
7049," â€œRepeal and replaceâ€ù was the centerpiece of many Republican campaigns for four cycles, and one of the most unifying positions among Republican voters",,
7049, It was not a coincidence that repealing Obamacare became President Trumpâ€™s first legislative priority after taking office,,
7049,"Protection for people with pre-existing conditions was a major part of the Affordable Care Act, but Democrats struggled to find ways to champion the law, which was unpopular and polarizing",,
7049," When asked, they would defend Obamacare",,
7049, But they rarely emphasized their support,,
7049," In 2014, ad research from Wesleyan shows, the vast majority of health care ads were those opposed to the health law",,
7049,"â€œIâ€™ll be the first to admit Iâ€™m as surprised as anyone to be in this position,â€ù said Brad Woodhouse, the executive director of the health care advocacy group Protect Our Care",,
7049, Mr,,
7049," Woodhouse worked at the Democratic National Committee when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, and saw Democrats struggle to discuss it in the years afterward",,
7049," â€œBut every poll we take, itâ€™s the issue thatâ€™s most important to people",,
7049,"â€ùThe newfound Democratic health care enthusiasm may not translate into victories, of course",,
7049," Republican campaigns are turning away from health care as a major issue this cycle, planning to pay more attention to other messages like immigration, job creation and attacks on Democrats",,
7049," When they talk about health care, many candidates are focusing on Democratic efforts to expand public health insurance coverage, not on continued calls to repeal Obamacare",,
7049,"â€œPeople tend to vote with their pocketbooks, and the strong economic performance will be at the forefront of every discussion this fall,â€ù said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, adding, â€œA contrast between single-payer health care and our ideas â€” a more patient-centered approach â€” is a debate we fully welcome",,
7049,â€ùBut some Republicans are sticking to the old anti-Obamacare script,,
7049," In Missouri, Ms",,
7049," McCaskillâ€™s expected opponent, Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, talks about health care frequently",,
7049," â€œI talk about Obamacare and just the broken health care system,â€ù he said, noting that the rising cost of health insurance is one of several factors eroding middle-class security",,
7049,Two main changes appear to have turned the tide on health care as an issue,,
7049, The Republican effort to repeal Obamacare last year made the embattled health law more popular than it has ever been,,
7049," For the first time, the Affordable Care Act earned the support of a majority of Americans in public polls, a small shift but one that has been durable, even as Congress moved on to a tax overhaul and other issues",,
7049, Pre-existing condition protections have always been much more popular than the law over all,,
7049,"The threat of repeal appears to have been particularly galvanizing for Democratic activists, who came out to protest and contact their legislators during the debate",,
7049,"The second change came more recently, when the Trump administration decided not to defend Obamacare from a lawsuit brought by the Republican attorneys general of 20 states",,
7049, The lawsuit argues that the entire law should be invalidated as unconstitutional,,
7049," The Trump administrationâ€™s position is that most of the law should remain on the books, but that its protections for people with pre-existing illnesses should be stripped away",,
7049,Mr,,
7049," Hawley is one of the attorneys general who has signed on to the lawsuit, though he argues that pre-existing conditions protections could be preserved without the Affordable Care Act",,
7049," Patrick Morrisey, the West Virginia attorney general, has also joined the lawsuit and is running for Senate",,
7049,"Several Democratic candidates and campaign consultants described the lawsuit as a political gift, because it clarified the contrast between the two parties on an emotionally resonant issue",,
7049,"â€œWhat has changed is all the warning lights are on right now,â€ù Mr",,
7049, Donnelly said,,
7050,"You hear it from Republicans, pundits and even some Democrats",,
7050," Itâ€™s often said in a tone of regret: I wish Obama had done health reform in a bipartisan way, rather than jamming through a partisan bill",,
7050,"The lament seems to have the ring of truth, given that not a single Republican in Congress voted for Obamacare",,
7050, Yet it is false â€”demonstrably so,,
7050,That itâ€™s nonetheless stuck helps explain how the Republicans have landed in such a mess on health care,,
7050," The Congressional Budget Office released a jaw-dropping report Monday estimating that the Republican health plan would take insurance from 24 million people, many of them Republican voters, and raise medical costs for others",,
7050," The bill effectively rescinds benefits for the elderly, poor, sick and middle class, and funnels the money to the rich, via tax cuts",,
7050,"The AARP doesnâ€™t like the bill, nor do groups representing doctors, nurses, hospitals, the disabled and people with cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis",,
7050," Other than that, Mrs",,
7050," Lincoln, itâ€™s a great bill",,
7050,"If Republicans still pass it, they will take political ownership of the flawed American health care system â€” after making it much more flawed",,
7050," Tom Cotton, the Republican senator from Arkansas, has said the bill is so bad that it would â€œput the House majority at risk next year",,
7050,"â€ù On the other hand, if Republicans fail to pass their own bill, theyâ€™ll look weak and incompetent, which is also not a good look to voters",,
7050,How did the partyâ€™s leaders put themselves in this position? The short answer is that they began believing their own hype and set out to solve a problem that doesnâ€™t exist,,
7050,Obamacare obviously has flaws,,
7050," Most important, some of its insurance markets â€” created to sell coverage to the uninsured â€” arenâ€™t functioning well enough",,
7050," Alas, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump are not trying to fix that problem",,
7050," Theyâ€™re trying to fix a fictional one: saving America from a partisan, socialistic big-government takeover of health care",,
7050,"To understand why that description is wrong, it helps to recall some history",,
7050, Democratic attempts to cover the uninsured stretch back almost a century,,
7050, But opposition to universal government-provided insurance was always too strong,,
7050," Even Lyndon Johnson, with big congressional majorities, could pass programs only for the elderly and the poor â€” over intense opposition that equated Medicare with the death of capitalism",,
7050,"So Democrats slowly moved their proposals to the right, relying more on private insurance rather than government programs",,
7050," As they shifted, though, Republicans shifted even farther right",,
7050, Bill Clintonâ€™s plan was quite moderate but still couldnâ€™t pass,,
7050,"When Barack Obama ran for president, he faced a choice",,
7050, He could continue moving the party to the center or tack back to the left,,
7050," The second option would have focused on government programs, like expanding Medicare to start at age 55",,
7050, But Obama and his team thought a plan that mixed government and markets â€” farther to the right of Clintonâ€™s â€” could cover millions of people and had a realistic chance of passing,,
7050,They embarked on a bipartisan approach,,
7050," They borrowed from Mitt Romneyâ€™s plan in Massachusetts, gave a big role to a bipartisan Senate working group, incorporated conservative ideas and won initial support from some Republicans",,
7050," The bill also won over groups that had long blocked reform, like the American Medical Association",,
7050,"But congressional Republicans ultimately decided that opposing any bill, regardless of its substance, was in their political interest",,
7050, The consultant Frank Luntz wrote an influential memo in 2009 advising Republicans to talk positively about â€œreformâ€ù while also opposing actual solutions,,
7050," McConnell, the Senate leader, persuaded his colleagues that they could make Obama look bad by denying him bipartisan cover",,
7050,"At that point, Obama faced a second choice â€“ between forging ahead with a substantively bipartisan bill and forgetting about covering the uninsured",,
7050, The kumbaya plan for which pundits now wax nostalgic was not an option,,
7050,The reason is simple enough: Obamacare is the bipartisan version of health reform,,
7050, It accomplishes a liberal end through conservative means and is much closer to the plan conservatives favored a few decades ago than the one liberals did,,
7050," â€œIt was the ultimate troll,â€ù as Michael Anne Kyle of Harvard Business School put it, â€œfor Obama to pass Republican health reform",,
7050,â€ùTodayâ€™s Republican Party has moved so far to the right that it no longer supports any plan that covers the uninsured,,
7050," Of course, Republican leaders are not willing to say as much, because they know how unpopular that position is",,
7050," Having run out of political ground, Ryan, McConnell and Trump have had to invent the notion of a socialistic Obamacare that they will repeal and replace with â€_ something great! This morning they were also left to pretend that the Budget Office report was something less than a disaster",,
7050,"Their approach to Obamacare has worked quite nicely for them, until now",,
7050, Lying can be an effective political tactic,,
7050," Believing your own alternative facts, however, is usually not so smart",,
7051,"The indictment of Martin Shkreli, the widely reviled head of a pharmaceutical company that secured the rights to a decades-old drug and then increased its price more than fiftyfold, was described by a F",,
7051,B,,
7051,I,,
7051," official as the â€œsecurities fraud trifecta of lies, deceit and greedâ€ù â€” nothing particularly new when it comes to defrauding hedge fund investors",,
7051,"What makes the case interesting is that a lawyer, Evan Greebel, has been charged as an accomplice for not protecting his corporate client that Mr",,
7051, Shkreli is accused of using essentially as a personal piggy bank,,
7051,"Lawyers are important players in corporate transactions, ensuring their clients comply with the rules",,
7051," But when legal advice pushes over the line into enabling fraud, then a lawyer can wind up on the wrong side of the law",,
7051,Mr,,
7051, Shkreli was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy for misleading investors in a hedge fund he managed about losses it suffered,,
7051," As The New York Times pointed out, this aspect of the case was little more than a small-time fraud in which investors were duped into believing their investment of a few million dollars was profitable when in fact Mr",,
7051, Shkreli made a series of bad stock picks â€” hardly the stuff of front-page headlines,,
7051,"After the investors protested, he was accused of funneling the assets of a biopharmaceutical company, Retrophin, of which he was the chief executive, to pay those claims",,
7051," Pulling that off required much more than fast talk because the company was publicly traded, so there were supposed to be internal controls in place to ensure proper management of its assets and a board of directors designated to watch over the enterprise",,
7051,That is where Mr,,
7051, Greebel comes into the picture,,
7051, He was the lead outside counsel and corporate secretary for Retrophin while working as a partner at the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman (he moved last summer to Kaye Scholer),,
7051, Mr,,
7051," Greebelâ€™s practice involved working on corporate transactions and, more recently, helping firms involved in Bitcoin",,
7051,Mr,,
7051, Greebel is charged with one count of conspiring with Mr,,
7051, Shkreli to commit wire fraud in connection with the claimed misuse of Retrophinâ€™s assets to pay off the hedge fund investors,,
7051," According to the indictment, he helped draft sham consulting agreements to mask the payments so that they appeared to be related to the companyâ€™s business",,
7051,In an email sent in response to a question from Mr,,
7051," Shkreli about why this type of arrangement was needed, Mr",,
7051," Greebel wrote, â€œWe can call it a settlement agreement, but given [the auditorâ€™s] recent behavior they may require it to be disclosed in the financials",,
7051, I was trying to prevent that issue,,
7051,"â€ù That sounds like standard legal advice a lawyer would give to a client about how to structure a transaction, setting forth alternatives and then explaining why one approach is better",,
7051,The prosecution of Mr,,
7051, Greebel raises the question about when legal advice crosses the line into aiding and abetting a fraud,,
7051," The starting point in the analysis is identifying the client, because that is the party the lawyer must ensure receives the benefit of the legal services",,
7051," That seemingly simple issue becomes much more complicated when a small corporation like Retrophin is the client because lawyers can sometimes let themselves slip into thinking that it is the individual officers, especially the chief executive, who are in need of protection",,
7051,"In a comment posted on Investorshub in February, Mr",,
7051," Shkreli defended his actions by claiming that â€œevery transaction Iâ€™ve ever made at Retrophin was done with outside counselâ€™s blessing (I have the bills to prove it), board approval and made good corporate sense",,
7051,â€ù That certainly makes it sound as if the lawyer was working on behalf of the chief executive,,
7051,But if the Justice Departmentâ€™s charge against Mr,,
7051," Greebel is true, then the first misstep appears to be that he put Mr",,
7051," Shkreliâ€™s interests ahead of Retrophin, his actual client",,
7051,Mr,,
7051, Greebel has pleaded not guilty and is fighting the charges,,
7051,"There is nothing inherently wrong with settling a case by creating a consulting arrangement, unless it is done to mislead the company making the payment into believing it is a legitimate transaction",,
7051, The reference in his email to Mr,,
7051," Shkreli about avoiding scrutiny from the outside auditor can be evidence that the agreements were not intended to protect the corporate client but rather to mislead it, something a companyâ€™s lawyer is certainly not supposed to do",,
7051,"Unlike a hedge fund investor who falls for a pitch from a fast-talking entrepreneur, shareholders depend on the company to have in place the protections needed to ensure it is being properly managed",,
7051,"Since the demise of Enron in 2002 after its lawyers did little to protect the company from wrongdoing by its executives, corporate counsel is now seen as one of the gatekeepers for a corporation required to ensure that it stays within the law",,
7051," When the companyâ€™s lawyer steps out of that role by aiding a chief executive in advancing his own interests, one of the key protections in place for investors is lost",,
7051,"The Securities and Exchange Commission, which also filed civil fraud charges against Mr",,
7051, Shkreli and Mr,,
7051," Greebel, has emphasized that it wants to focus on corporate gatekeepers for failing to protect companies and their investors from fraud",,
7051,Kara M,,
7051," Stein, an S",,
7051,E,,
7051,C,,
7051," commissioner, raised the issue of whether the agency was not being tough enough in pursuing lawyers for misconduct at corporate clients",,
7051," â€œAre we treating lawyers differently from other gatekeepers, such as accountants? I think we should carefully review the role that lawyers play in our markets, with a view towards how they can better help deter misconduct and prevent fraud,â€ù she said in a speech in 2014",,
7051,The charge against Mr,,
7051," Greebel focuses on his role as one of Retrophinâ€™s gatekeepers, claiming that the failure to protect his client constitutes aiding and abetting Mr",,
7051, Shkreliâ€™s crime,,
7051," If the lawyer confuses who the client is, then it can be easy to fall into the trap of believing that the best interests of an individual officer are paramount",,
7051,"For Retrophin, the indictment represents a measure of vindication",,
7051, The charges largely track a lawsuit filed by the company against Mr,,
7051," Shkreli in August claiming that he violated his fiduciary duty of loyalty to the company by misusing its assets for personal purposes by paying off investors in his hedge funds, seeking $65 million in compensation",,
7051, (Mr,,
7051, Greebel was not named in that lawsuit,,
7051,")But in an odd twist, Retrophin may have to pay more money in the case before it can ever recover",,
7051," Under its bylaws, the company is required to advance the legal expenses of any director or officer who is the subject of a criminal prosecution or civil lawsuit related to conduct while at the company",,
7051," Retrophin is incorporated in Delaware, whose Chancery Court has been aggressive in protecting the rights of individuals seeking payment of legal fees from a former corporate employer",,
7051,That means the company may have to pay for the lawyers while Mr,,
7051, Shkreli and Mr,,
7051," Greebel defend the criminal and civil cases, a claim it is sure to fight but may wind up losing",,
7052,"ROME â€” The populist parties that won Italyâ€™s elections two months ago by demonizing the political establishment, the European Union and illegal migrants in often vulgar terms were granted the go-ahead on Wednesday to form a government, crystallizing some of the biggest fears of Europeâ€™s leaders, who were already bracing for turbulence",,
7052,"The rapid ascent of populists in Italy â€” the birthplace of Fascism, a founding member of the European Union, and the blocâ€™s fourth-largest economy â€” shattered the nationâ€™s decades-old party system",,
7052,"It also gave fresh energy to the nationalist impulses tugging at the Continent and moved the greatest threat to the European Unionâ€™s cohesion from newer member states on the periphery, such as Hungary and Poland, to its very core",,
7052,"After 80 days of arduous talks, President Sergio Mattarella gave a mandate to form a government to the partiesâ€™ consensus pick for prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, a little-known lawyer with no government experience",,
7052,"Critics assert that he will be but a pawn of the populist parties behind him: the Five Star Movement, a web-based protest party untested at a national level; and the League, a hard-right party that campaigned on a stridently Italians-first platform",,
7052,Mr,,
7052, Conte promised â€œa government of changeâ€ù that would â€œsafeguard the interests of Italiansâ€ù after emerging from a nearly two-hour meeting with the president at the Quirinal Palace and greeting a throng of reporters,,
7052,"â€œI am aware of the necessity to confirm the European and international position of Italy,â€ù he added, in a nod to the concerns the rise of the populist parties have stirred in Europe over their avowed agenda to crack down on illegal immigration, challenge budget rules from Brussels and lift sanctions against Russia",,
7052,"â€œThis is an historic moment,â€ù Luigi Di Maio, 31, leader of the Five Star Movement, said in a Facebook Live video Wednesday night, calling it a â€œa real and true liberation",,

7052,"But the populist leaders stuck with him, saying the alternative to Mr",,

7052,As Mr,,
7052," Conte met with the president, Mr",,

7052," It was quickly amended, and the party leaders moved to assure international observers that things would be fine",,
7052,Often the populist leaders seemed to be performing for an audience of one,,
7052, But Mr,,
7052," Mattarellaâ€™s power, absolute during the crisis, would transfer to the new government once its leaders took office",,
7052,Mr,,
7052," Fabbrini said that government could move Italy beyond its traditional West European partners and closer to countries like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland that are increasingly challenging the European Union",,
7052,"â€œThis is a group that would rather hollow it out from the inside, demanding more power over immigration, control of the border, a more loose stability and growth pact,â€ù Mr",,
7052, Fabbrini said,,
7052, â€œItâ€™s a more insidious coalition,,
7052,"â€ùUnder a Five Star and League government, Italy would be by far the largest voice of such a group, an unwelcome development for officials in Brussels",,
7052, But the cold shoulder those leaders gave to Italyâ€™s outgoing center-left government on migration only fueled anti-migrant anger that benefited the populists,,
7052,"As the migrants kept coming, the anti-migrant League grew stronger",,
7052," The Five Star Movement also took a harder line, though its core message addressed the economic frustration of young Italians, especially those in the economically depressed south",,
7052,"Despite its difficulty governing cities, such as Rome, Five Star has gained electoral strength, in part because its studied vagueness on controversial issues has avoided alienating voters on the left and right",,
7052,Many Italians are unclear where it stands,,
7052," Its leaders have questioned the countryâ€™s membership in the eurozone, supported it, and recently questioned it again",,
7052," They say they want Italy to be more balanced in its foreign policy, but have grown closer to President Vladimir V",,
7052, Putin of Russia,,
7052, Their position on the dangers of vaccines keeps changing,,
7052,"Party leaders attribute those changes to what they call direct democracy, expressed in online clicks of members who decide policies and candidates",,
7052," Critics have instead raised questions about Davide Casaleggio, the son of the partyâ€™s late founder and an unelected businessman who controls Five Starâ€™s web platform",,
7052,The allianceâ€™s governing contract was ratified in recent days by the partiesâ€™ bases,,
7052," It includes proposals that critics say have the potential to erode Italyâ€™s representative democracy, such as banning members of Parliament from switching parties, or from dissenting from the party line",,
7052,"The League, a more traditional right-wing party with formal associations with Franceâ€™s National Front and Mr",,
7052," Putinâ€™s Russia United Party, started as a northern separatist movement",,
7052,But under Mr,,
7052," Salvini, the Leagueâ€™s traditional theme â€” the excoriation of the work ethic of Italian southerners â€” switched to rallying Italians against the invasion of African migrants from the south and the meddling of Brussels bureaucrats from the north",,
7052,"Sofia Ventura, a professor of political science at the University of Bologna, said the new coalition was a â€œmixture between ideology and incompetence",,
7052,â€ùBut Europeâ€™s populists welcomed the new alliance warmly,,
7052,"In an article published on Wednesday in the newspaper Corriere della Sera, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, said that the â€œEurope of nations is close at handâ€ù and heralded the new government as a harbinger for the collapse of the European Union",,
7052,"Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party who helped lead the campaign for Britainâ€™s withdrawal from the European Union, has relished the prospect of the Italians giving the Germans a headache",,
7052,Stephen K,,
7052," Bannon, an architect of the election of President Trump who said he had kept in close contact with League leaders, also welcomed the â€œhistoricâ€ù alliance with Five Star",,
7052,"â€œFirst anti-establishment government in Europe,â€ù he said in an interview, saying more would come",,
7052, â€œFirst government built on populism and nationalism as its foundation,,
7052,"â€ùOn Wednesday night, Mr",,
7052, Conte said he was eager to represent that government at home and abroad,,
7052," â€œI offer myself as the defense lawyer of the Italian people,â€ù he said",,
7053,HONG KONG â€” Chinaâ€™s bungled stock market bailout was a significant setback to its decades-long efforts to build a modern financial system,,
7053,Its currency devaluation shocked global investors and altered the policy calculus at central banks from Hanoi to Washington,,
7053,A highly anticipated package of overhauls to sprawling state-owned companies was a crushing rebuke to hopes that China would move to privatize such businesses,,
7053," Instead of reducing their stakes, the Communist Party said it would increase its control over such companies",,
7053,"To many global policy makers and investors, Chinaâ€™s spate of surprises is driven by the governmentâ€™s need to get the economy back on track",,
7053,Growth is slipping,,
7053, The latest data on Monday showed that the economy grew at  6,,
7053,"9 percent in the third quarter, its lowest level since 2009",,
7053, And Beijing is scrambling to respond to the pressures,,
7053,"While President Xi Jinping says the country is committed to financial reform, the resulting measures send the message that China is backpedaling on those efforts",,
7053, It is a new and shifting landscape that is proving difficult for the rest of the world to navigate,,
7053,"â€œPeople say reform is coming, but youâ€™re giving back your reforms,â€ù Fraser Howie, a longtime banker in Asia and co-author of â€œRed Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of Chinaâ€™s Extraordinary Rise,â€ù said of the recent actions by Chinese authorities",,
7053,"â€œThat defeats the whole purpose; you either embrace markets or not,â€ù he said",,
7053,"For years, the technocrats who control the levers of Chinaâ€™s economy have been heralded as farsighted planners",,
7053," What they promised, they generally delivered, and any doubts could be dispelled by the nationâ€™s torrid economic growth",,
7053,"But that image has been shattered in recent months, as an expanding cast of agencies and officials regularly roll out ambitious plans with little warning and explanation",,
7053," In China, some economic decisions are treated like state secrets, forcing global investors and policy makers to adjust quickly",,
7053,The Peopleâ€™s Bank of China routinely surprises the market with major policy announcements on evenings and weekends,,
7053," Its counterpart, the United States Federal Reserve, tries to telegraph its moves long in advance",,
7053,It is all complicated by the competition and the lack of coordination among the many agencies charged with managing Chinaâ€™s economy,,
7053," The central bank, securities regulator, Finance Ministry and economic planning agency, among others, have different agendas and goals",,
7053,The collective result is that it is difficult to discern exactly what is happening in China,,
7053," From the outside, officials appear to be changing course on long-held reform plans that are broadly considered critical for the health of the economy",,
7053,"In June, Chinaâ€™s chief securities regulator outlined sweeping plans to help turn millions of cash-starved start-up companies into innovative corporate champions by making it easier to raise money and go public",,
7053," The initiative would â€œstrengthen the vitality of the entire economy,â€ù Xiao Gang, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a financial forum in Shanghai",,
7053,"With Chinaâ€™s stock markets tumbling a week later, he appeared to sacrifice his free-market agenda",,
7053, Mr,,
7053," Xiaoâ€™s agency banned new  listings, barred big shareholders from selling and ordered brokerages to buy aggressively",,
7053,"â€œThe stock-market rescue revived questions regarding the leadershipâ€™s commitment to economic liberalization and whether that is even what the administration means by reform,â€ù said Matthew P",,
7053," Goodman, a senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who was an author of a two-year study on economic decision-making in China that was published in March",,
7053, â€œIt is now pretty clear that things are not going according to plan,,
7053,"â€ùThe current pressures in China signal a shift from the rosier outlook two years ago, when President Xi introduced a platform of financial overhauls intended to give the market a â€œdecisiveâ€ù role in the direction of economic growth",,
7053," At the same time, Mr",,
7053," Xi has aggressively asserted his primacy in driving Chinaâ€™s economic policy and reforms, an area that was traditionally overseen by the prime minister",,
7053,"â€œThe focus on centralizing authority has been a big theme of Xiâ€™s, and also this more politicized and nationalist environment that Xi has inaugurated has had very clear effects on the progress of economic reform,â€ù said Andrew Batson, the China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial consultancy in Beijing",,
7053,"â€œThatâ€™s not necessarily 100 percent negative,â€ù Mr",,
7053, Batson added,,
7053, â€œBut itâ€™s certainly not the universally pro-market reform agenda that some people were expecting,,
7053,â€ùThe confusion over the countryâ€™s commitment to financial reform has increased volatility far beyond Chinaâ€™s borders,,
7053,Chinaâ€™s central bank has explained the devaluation on Aug,,
7053," 11 as a one-time adjustment that was meant to make the currency, whose value had been tightly controlled by the government for years, more market-driven",,
7053, But the suddenness of the move spurred competitive devaluations in Vietnam and Kazakhstan,,
7053, The tumult even prompted the Fed to hold off raising interest rates at its Sept,,
7053, 17 meeting,,
7053,"â€œI think developments that we saw in financial markets in August in part reflected concerns that there was downside risk to Chinese economic performance, and perhaps concerns about the deftness with which policy makers were addressing those concerns,â€ù Janet L",,
7053," Yellen, the Fedâ€™s chairwoman, told reporters after that meeting",,
7053,"Zhou Xiaochuan, the long-serving head of Chinaâ€™s central bank, has not commented directly on the devaluation",,
7053," In a recent essay, he argued that China had made impressive progress in financial overhauls over recent decades, but he also acknowledged that the global financial crisis and other factors had delayed some changes",,
7053,"â€œToday the conditions are there to advance reforms for market changes, internationalization and diversification,â€ù Mr",,
7053, Zhou wrote in China Finance magazine,,
7053," â€œBut in this process, there are some things that require catching up, because there have been planned reforms that, owing to the crisis and other factors, were pigeonholed",,
7053,"â€ùFor China, the risk in delaying promised financial overhauls is that longstanding economic issues, like the countryâ€™s ballooning corporate and government debt problem, might get worse",,
7053,State-controlled media reported on Monday that Prime Minister Li Keqiang had met with the leaders of some of Chinaâ€™s biggest banks on Friday and issued a broad promise to prop up companies in financial trouble,,
7053," According to the Beijing Times, Mr",,
7053," Li declared that China â€œwill not cut or withdraw loans to those companies with difficulties but good market prospects,â€ù and will â€œgive necessary capital support to companies undergoing bankruptcies or regrouping",,
7053,"â€ùIn October 2014, Lou Jiwei, the finance minister, announced a bold plan to clean up trillions of dollars of local government debts, spending that has traditionally played a major role in Chinaâ€™s efforts to stimulate the economy",,
7053," But policy makers have appeared partly to backtrack, allowing local governments to continue adding new debt through riskier methods like borrowing through unregulated holding companies",,
7053,"â€œRelative to the plan announced last year, the pace of reform now is slower,â€ù Nicholas Zhu, a vice president at Moodyâ€™s Investors Service based in Beijing, said of the local government debt efforts",,
7053, â€œThe reason is because the sharper-than-expected slowdown of economic growth since earlier this year has changed the policy focus more towards stabilization of the economy,,
7053,"â€ùThe most recent development to set off doubts about Chinaâ€™s commitment to economic reforms came last month, when the government released a much-anticipated policy document on the overhaul of its gigantic state-owned sector",,
7053,"A few days after the proposal was published, the Communist Partyâ€™s powerful Central Committee followed up with a document that bluntly ruled out loosening the partyâ€™s grip on state firms",,
7053,"Party leadership â€œcan only be strengthened rather than undermined, as state-owned enterprise reforms have entered the deepwater zone,â€ù the Central Committee document said, according to a report by Xinhua, Chinaâ€™s official news agency",,
7053,"The party leadership over state firms â€œis vital in ensuring the socialist direction of their developmentâ€ù and would â€œenhance their competitiveness and competence,â€ù Xinhua added",,
7053,"Despite signs of stasis on the ground, Chinese officials continue to talk up a pro-reform agenda in public, which adds to the murkiness",,
7053,"On his visit to the United States last month, Mr",,
7053," Xi, Chinaâ€™s president, repeatedly drove home his commitment to pushing through economic overhauls",,
7053,"â€œThe key to Chinaâ€™s development lies in reform,â€ù Mr",,
7053, Xi said in a speech in Seattle,,
7053,"â€œWhen it comes to the toughest reforms, only those with courage will carry the day,â€ù he added",,
7053, â€œWe have the resolve and the guts to press ahead,,
7053,â€ù,,
7054,With Donald J,,
7054," Trumpâ€™s choice of Tom Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services, itâ€™s clear that Republicans have a good chance of fulfilling their pledge to repeal Obamacare",,
7054," In January, Republican majorities passed a measure similar to the one now proposed, which President Obama promptly vetoed",,
7054," But with control of the presidency, they can prevail",,
7054,The prospect portends one of the biggest political backlashes in recent history,,
7054," On Monday, a search of The New York Times archives since 1981 turned up 344 articles containing the phrase â€œBe careful what you wish for",,
7054,"â€ù As the repeal effort gathers steam, expect that number to grow sharply",,
7054,"Opponents of the Affordable Care Act have denounced it bitterly for more than six years, so it is not surprising that, despite the programâ€™s successes, public opinion about it would be divided",,
7054," Even so, a repeal would unleash the awesome power of loss aversion, among the more deeply rooted human tendencies known to behavioral scientists",,
7054, Their consistent finding: The amount of effort people will expend to resist being stripped of something they already possess is significantly larger than the effort they will devote to acquiring something they donâ€™t already have,,
7054,"When the possession in question is an insignificant material object, such as a coffee mug, people must be offered roughly twice as much to part with it as they would have been willing to pay to acquire it initially",,
7054," If the possession relates to health or safety, that ratio becomes drastically larger",,
7054,"In one experiment, subjects who were asked to imagine having been exposed to a rare fatal disease â€” there was a 1 in 1,000 chance they had caught it â€” were willing to pay only $2,000 for the only available dose of the antidote",,
7054," The same subjects said that, under the same conditions, they would pay roughly 250 times as much to avoid any exposure to the disease if there was no available antidote",,
7054,"The asymmetry is striking, since in both cases, people would be buying a one-in-a-thousand chance at reducing their likelihood of death",,
7054, The findings suggest that people would fight hundreds of times harder to retain the health benefits they currently possess than they would to acquire those same benefits if they lacked them,,
7054,The scale of the losses at stake for Obamacare is staggering,,
7054, A study by the Urban Institute estimates that a repeal would result in almost 30 million Americans losing their health coverage,,
7054, Research on loss aversion thus suggests that the repeal would precipitate a political firestorm of epic proportions,,
7054,Republicans have promised to replace Obamacare with something better,,
7054," Everyone, Mr",,
7054," Trump included, insists that any plan must require insurers to offer affordable coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions",,
7054, But thatâ€™s not possible financially unless the insured pool includes predominantly healthy people,,
7054," And because many healthy people wonâ€™t buy insurance unless they are required to do so, no developed country relegates its health coverage entirely to unregulated private insurance markets",,
7054,"The same logic explains why private/government hybrid programs â€” like Obamacare, and its predecessor in Massachusetts, Romneycare â€” include an individual mandate",,
7054," Opponents of the mandate argue that it limits individual freedom, which of course it does",,
7054," But traffic lights and homicide laws also limit individual freedom; everyone celebrates liberty, but sometimes we must choose among competing freedoms",,
7054, Failure to include a mandate would eliminate the freedom of citizens to purchase affordable health insurance,,
7054," In such cases, we must decide which of the competing freedoms is more important",,
7054,The third feature of Obamacare (and Romneycare) is that both provide subsidies for low-income people,,
7054, You simply cannot require people to buy something they cannot afford,,
7054,"In short, itâ€™s logically impossible to cobble together a private-insurer-based replacement for Obamacare that offers affordable coverage to people with pre-existing conditions without also including an individual mandate and subsidies",,
7054," Thatâ€™s why, despite scores of House votes to repeal it, no one has come forward with a coherent proposal to replace it",,
7054, Hence the dilemma currently facing Republicans,,
7054,Some hope they can sidestep it by enacting a â€œrepeal and delayâ€ù bill â€” one that repeals the Affordable Care Act immediately while promising to replace it with an unspecified alternative several years hence,,
7054, That wonâ€™t solve the problem,,
7054," As numerous health economists have explained, repeal without immediate replacement would result in a speedy collapse of the Obamacare insurance exchanges",,
7054,Bad times are looming for health insurance,,
7054, If Mr,,
7054," Trump wants to avoid a political buzz saw, what might he do? Unlike Republican congressional leaders, he seems to have no ideological commitment to a largely unregulated, and hence untenable, private health insurance system",,
7054, And he has already demonstrated that Republican base voters will side with him rather than their congressional leaders,,
7054,"The upshot is that, unlike President Obama, he may actually have the political power to enact the most sensible system for providing basic universal health coverage: the single-payer approach taken by most other developed countries",,
7054," Older Americans have been covered under a single-payer system since the 1965 enactment of Medicare, which delivers basic health coverage more cost effectively than private insurance plans can, and which they are of course free to supplement with private insurance",,
7054,"But having just announced plans to phase out Medicare, Republicans are extremely unlikely to voluntarily embrace a single-payer insurance option for all Americans, and Mr",,
7054," Trumpâ€™s true intentions are, to say the least, unclear",,
7054,So buckle up,,
7054," Whatever happens, thereâ€™s a rough ride ahead",,
7055,"RIO DE JANEIRO â€” How does an aspiring entrepreneur navigate the economic and political crises dogging Brazil? Build a growing taxi-app start-up, naturally",,
7055, The financing will come,,
7055,"Thatâ€™s the approach being taken by 99Taxis, based in SÃ£o Paulo and one of Uberâ€™s main competitors in Brazil",,
7055," It has begun a new financing round, seeking about $100 million, according to two people familiar with the companyâ€™s plans",,
7055," That would be one of the largest fund-raising efforts for a Brazilian Internet start-up in the last decade, including the boom years",,
7055,"The details, including which investment firm will lead the round, have not yet been completed, the individuals said, because the company is still deciding whether to bring on new investors or stay with its current ones",,
7055,"However, the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, which led two prior rounds for 99Taxis this year, is expected to put in more money, one of the individuals said",,
7055,"Even though Tiger led Uberâ€™s latest financing round, it is expected to invest in this round",,
7055," It also backed its main competitors in other large emerging markets: Didi Kuaidi in China, GrabTaxi in Indonesia, and Ola in India",,
7055,So far Uber has not been able to win any of those markets and faces long odds in doing so,,
7055, That is most likely true in Brazil as well,,
7055,"In the next few weeks, 99Taxis expects to complete the new roundâ€™s structure, with the formal close expected to take place during the first quarter of next year, according to one of the individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan",,
7055,"The new financing would allow 99Taxis, which was founded in 2012 and whose current largest outside shareholder is Tiger Global, to continue to stay ahead of Uber here",,
7055,"Brazil has two main taxi-app incumbents, 99Taxis and Easy Taxi, which is backed by Rocket Internet",,
7055," Since February, Easy Taxiâ€™s market share has steadily declined, based on the percentage of mobile users who have installed the app, according to data provided by the research firm 7Park Data",,
7055, Easy Taxiâ€™s share peaked at 18,,
7055,9 percent in February but fell to 14,,
7055,8 percent by mid-November,,
7055," And 99Taxis â€œhas been on a steady ascent,â€ù the firm said, growing to 15",,
7055,6 percent from 9 percent this year; it has been the market leader since October,,
7055, Uber was No,,
7055, 3 at 6,,
7055,5 percent,,
7055,"Uber, the Silicon Valley company, started operating in Brazil only last year during the World Cup and ran into many problems as it sought to expand in this country, Latin Americaâ€™s largest economy",,
7055,It has drawn the ire of hundreds of politicians and been banned in the cities of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro,,
7055, It has angered taxi drivers and labor leaders here,,
7055," Uber has sought to portray those critics as old-school, anti-innovation protectionists",,
7055,"Yet many of those taxi drivers use 99Taxis, whose earlier investors include Qualcomm Ventures and the SÃ£o Paulo-based Monashees Capital, whose limited partners include Cisco Systems and Silicon Valley Bankâ€™s fund of funds group SVB Capital, hardly opponents of innovation or free-market economics",,
7055,Uber caught a break here recently,,
7055," After the company filed a complaint with Brazilâ€™s antitrust watchdog, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, or CADE, the agency said it would investigate taxi unions for what it argued was their â€œanti-competitive behaviorâ€ù against Uber",,
7055, Yet that investigation is expected to take months and does not target the taxi-app start-ups,,
7055,"The economic research unit of CADE published a study this month concluding that for now, Uber was not taking business away from taxi drivers or 99Taxis and Easy Taxi",,
7055,"On the contrary, the report said of Uber that, â€œrather than absorbing a significant portion of rides made by taxis, in truth, in a majority of cases, it obtained new clients who do not use taxis",,
7055,â€ù It contended that the company was â€œgenerating a new demand,,
7055,"â€ù Still, it acknowledged that that could change once Uber became more aggressive as it had in other markets",,
7055,"The taxi start-upâ€™s new capital, if the deal closes, would pair with good news from the SÃ£o Paulo city government",,
7055," This month, in a new program, it awarded 5,000 new licenses to taxi drivers who want to operate a so-called black-car service",,
7055," In order to participate, they are required to use a mobile app",,
7055,"The initiative has since been temporarily suspended by SÃ£o Pauloâ€™s Court of Accounts, which said it did not receive required documents from the mayorâ€™s office in sufficient time, but most expect this to be resolved soon and that the program will move forward early next year",,
7055,"The program grew out of the aftermath of the City Councilâ€™s recent passage of a bill banning unauthorized ride-sharing services, like Uber",,
7055," Although the mayor, Fernando Haddad, signed it into law, he has made urban mobility a focus, and so sought a third way, acknowledging the cityâ€™s taxi fleet needed upgrades",,
7055,"This new initiative is likely to benefit local companies like 99Taxis, which since its founding only works with licensed drivers",,
7055," That allows it to go head-to-head with Uber in the premium ride service category, which it had not been able to do previously",,
7055, It is calling its new service 99Top,,
7055,"Drivers will have to buy the black cars themselves, but will receive discounted financing from the public bank Banco do Brasil, said Rodrigo PirajÃ¡, executive director of SP Negocios, which is running the program for the city",,
7055,"Uber declined a chance to participate in this, he said",,
7055,Yet Uberâ€™s fate here is hardly sealed,,
7055, One result of CADEâ€™s current investigation is that SÃ£o Paulo is looking again for a way to incorporate Uber,,
7055, Mr,,
7055, PirajÃ¡ said he and SÃ£o Pauloâ€™s mayorâ€™s office were examining alternative ways to normalize Uber,,
7055," â€œIt is under analysis,â€ù he said",,

7056," To settle allegations of money-laundering and mortgage abuses, it has paid billions of dollars â€” but has not been criminally charged",,
7056,That has spurred an outcry that the bank is â€œtoo big to jail,,

7056,"The global head of HSBCâ€™s foreign exchange cash trading desk, Mark Johnson, a Briton, was arrested by federal agents Tuesday night at Kennedy International Airport as he was boarding a flight to London",,
7056,"He and Stuart Scott, the former head of the bankâ€™s currency trading desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud related to a transaction on behalf of a corporate client, exchanging dollars for British pounds",,

7056,HSBC has previously said the Justice Department is continuing to investigate the bank,,
7056, It has set aside an additional $1,,
7056,"3 billion for further potential settlements, according to a filing last summer",,
7056,"Robert Sherman, a spokesman for HSBC, which is based in London, said on Wednesday that the bank had been and would continue to cooperate with the Justice Departmentâ€™s foreign exchange investigation",,
7056,"While HSBC was not implicated in Wednesdayâ€™s criminal complaint, the case is another black eye for the London-based bank that has substantial operations in the United States",,
7056,"In 2012, it paid $1",,
7056,9 billion in fines to United States authorities to settle allegations of being a conduit for illegal money,,
7056, The deal included a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Manhattan district attorneyâ€™s office and the Justice Department,,
7056,"The Justice Departmentâ€™s decision not to criminally charge HSBC in that case received renewed scrutiny last week, when a report prepared by Republican staff of the House Financial Services Committee showed that prosecutors at the Justice Department wanted to criminally charge the bank, but were overruled by top officials in the department, including the attorney general at the time, Eric H",,
7056, Holder Jr,,
7056,And HSBC paid $550 million in 2014 to settle allegations that it made billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities appear to be compliant with regulations,,
7056,"The latest case stems from 2011, when HSBC was one of 10 banks that were invited to bid for the right to execute the currency transaction on behalf of Cairn Energy",,
7056, Each competing bank was required to sign a confidentiality agreement,,
7056,"In its bid submission, HSBC pledged it could â€œprovide one quote for the full amount or even drip feed the market in the utmost confidential nature so as to ensure there are no sudden FX moves against the company,â€ù according to the complaint",,
7056,"But when HSBC won the bid in October of 2011, it did the exact opposite, the complaint says",,
7056," After securing the lucrative job, a supervisor at HSBC told Mr",,
7056," Scott on a call that the bank did not want to â€œpush the market too muchâ€ù higher â€œand at the same time we want to make money on this,â€ù according to the complaint",,
7056,Mr,,
7056, Johnson and Mr,,
7056," Scott began to buy British pounds in exchange for other currencies, which they later sold for a profit to HSBC on the day of Cairnâ€™s currency deal on Dec",,
7056," 7, the government said",,
7056,"In a call to discuss the details of Cairnâ€™s transaction with HSBC, Mr",,
7056," Scott â€œfalsely and fraudulentlyâ€ù advised representatives at Cairn on the best time of the day to execute the trade, according to the complaint",,
7056,When an adviser working on behalf of the company questioned Mr,,
7056," Scottâ€™s logic, he added that if traders in the market were aware of the transaction, â€œthey will try to jump in front and start to muck around in the markets,â€ù according to the complaint",,
7056, Mr,,
7056, Johnson also gave his own personal recommendation along the same lines,,
7056,"Minutes after the call ended, Mr",,
7056, Scott and Mr,,
7056, Johnson began aggressively buying up pounds,,
7056,"When Cairn representatives did notice the sudden spike in the price of the British pound and asked HSBC, the person was told the spike in trading was the result of a Russian bank buying pounds at the same time as Cairn",,
7056,Mr,,
7056," Johnson, according to the complaint, was surprised to learn that Cairn Energy decided to go ahead with the multibillion-dollar currency transaction, even as his trading in the markets had caused the price of the currency to soar to its highest point of the day",,
7056,"Responding to the news, Mr",,
7056," Johnson replied, â€œOhhhh, Christmas,â€ù using an expletive as an adjective",,
7057,"While we obsess over domestic politics â€” not that thereâ€™s anything wrong with that, since a lot depends on whether the next leader of the worldâ€™s most powerful nation is a racist xenophobe, a sinister theocrat, an empty suit, or all of the above  â€” something scary is going on in financial markets, where bond prices in particular are indicating near-panic",,
7057,"I know, Paul Samuelson famously quipped that the stock market had predicted nine of the last five recessions; the wisdom of crowds is often overrated",,
7057," Still, bond markets are a bit less flighty than stocks, and also more closely tied to the economic outlook",,
7057, (A weak economy has mixed effects on stocks â€” low profits but also low interest rates â€” while it has an unambiguous effect on bonds,,
7057,") What plunging rates tell us is that markets are expecting very weak economies and possibly deflation for years to come, if not full-blown crisis",,
7057,"Among other things, such a world would be a very bad place into which to elect a member of a party that has spent the past 7 years inveighing against both fiscal and monetary stimulus, and has learned nothing from the utter failure of its predictions to come true",,
7058,"WEST DES MOINES, Iowa â€” A nagging problem hovers over Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as he crisscrosses the country seeking support in the states with the first four nominating contests: With a month and a half until the voting begins, he still has not committed himself fully to trying to win any of them",,
7058,"That hedged, wait-and-see approach served Mr",,
7058," Rubio well as he floated to the top tier of national polls, won the backing of influential Republican financiers and began drawing hundreds to his rallies",,
7058," His aides, flouting age-old political wisdom, started suggesting that he might not even need to win Iowa or New Hampshire â€” that a second- or third-place finish could be enough",,
7058,"But as the primary fight becomes fiercer, and Mr",,
7058," Rubioâ€™s closest competitors start zeroing in on a single, must-win contest â€” like Iowa for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and New Hampshire for Gov",,
7058, Chris Christie of New Jersey â€” Mr,,
7058," Rubioâ€™s all-things-to-all-people strategy is stretching his campaign thin, posing challenges in focusing his message and raising doubts among his supporters about his seriousness",,
7058,"Some Rubio backers in the first four states to vote â€” Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada â€” are voicing concern about whether Mr",,
7058, Rubio is leaving voters there with the impression that he does not need them to win,,
7058, And some of Mr,,
7058, Rubioâ€™s own aides are now arguing privately that they should do more to push back against the belief that he is running an indifferent campaign before it becomes too widespread,,
7058,"â€œThe campaign efforts for Marco Rubio in Iowa can very easily be perceived as wanting to place in the top three in the caucus and not necessarily to win,â€ù said Kenney Linhart, a pastor in Des Moines who is supporting the Rubio campaign",,
7058, Regardless of how serious Mr,,
7058," Rubio is about trying to win the state, Mr",,
7058," Linhart added, the belief that he is not is harmful: â€œPerception is as powerful as intent or will",,
7058,â€ùMost recent polls put Mr,,
7058," Rubio in third place in Iowa, behind Donald J",,
7058, Trump and Mr,,
7058, Cruz,,
7058," Though he is not in the lead in any of the states that vote first, he generally finds himself in the top three or four",,
7058,"Indeed, Mr",,
7058, Rubioâ€™s light footprint in Iowa has been the talk of the stateâ€™s political community for months,,
7058," He was unable to hire a local operative to run his campaign there, and instead brought in an Arkansas-based Republican strategist, Clint Reed, in September to oversee his Iowa campaign",,
7058, And Mr,,
7058," Rubio is relying on 31-year-old Eric Teetsel, who lives in Kansas, to handle outreach to social conservatives and evangelicals â€” rankling some Iowans used to a more neighborly outreach",,
7058,Inexperience and inattention to detail on the ground can have a tangible cost,,
7058, Melody Slater is a former Lee County chairwoman for the now-defunct presidential campaign of Gov,,
7058, Scott Walker of Wisconsin,,
7058, Shortly after Mr,,
7058," Walker dropped out, Mr",,
7058, Rubioâ€™s campaign announced that Ms,,

7058, Walkerâ€™s backers who had signed on with them,,
7058,But now she says she is having second thoughts,,
7058," â€œI had three campaigns call me that day â€” Huckabee, Cruz and Rubio,â€ù Ms",,
7058," Slater said in an interview, explaining that she agreed to endorse Mr",,
7058, Rubio only at his campaignâ€™s request,,
7058, She said she still liked Mr,,

7058,"â€œYouâ€™ve got to be careful about what you say, donâ€™t you?â€ù Ms",,
7058, Slater mused,,
7058,"From the Rubio campaignâ€™s perspective, not putting a marker down yet in any state means not having to set expectations that might not be met",,
7058, His advisers do not want to face the possibility of fading in a state they said they could win,,
7058, And they have told supporters and donors that Jeb Bushâ€™s surprisingly lackluster campaign left them with more time to make their move,,
7058,"â€œWeâ€™re doing things differently,â€ù said Bobby Kauffman, a Republican state senator in Iowa who is helping the Rubio campaign",,
7058, â€œPeople donâ€™t like things being done differently,,
7058,"â€ùIn the meantime, advisers are relying on a robust digital outreach program in the early-voting states and using local and national television to increase Mr",,
7058, Rubioâ€™s visibility,,
7058," When he campaigns, he tends to eschew small towns and venues for larger population centers and media markets",,
7058,"â€œExposure is Marcoâ€™s friend,â€ù said his pollster, Whit Ayers",,
7058, â€œAnd exposure is the enemy of a whole lot of the rest of these candidates,,
7058,"â€ùCampaign advisers readily dismiss as superficial the older quantifiable signs of seriousness about Iowaâ€™s tradition-bound caucuses, like lining up endorsements in all 99 counties or dotting the state with campaign offices",,
7058," They refused even to divulge the number of staff members on the campaignâ€™s payroll in Iowa, dismissing such details as the preoccupation of obsessives in the news media and on rival campaigns",,
7058,"Yet, if Mr",,
7058," Rubioâ€™s campaign styles itself as more attuned to a modern media age when more voters can be reached through Facebook and Fox News, there are plenty of people who prefer being wooed as if it were still a landline and postage-stamp era",,
7058,Mr,,
7058, Rubio is not likely to decide where to make his move until sometime next month,,
7058," His schedule this week â€” both in his public rallies and private meetings â€” shows what a broad appeal he is trying to make: After sitting down with the billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson in Las Vegas before Tuesday nightâ€™s debate, Mr",,
7058, Rubio set off for Iowa where he continued his efforts to woo evangelical Christian voters,,
7058, He will visit New Hampshire next and then South Carolina,,
7058,Every Republican nominee in modern times has won Iowa or New Hampshire at a minimum,,
7058," But until now, at least, Mr",,
7058, Rubioâ€™s strategy has pointed toward a test of whether a candidate who finishes no better than second in either could still manage to stay alive,,
7058,It is a risky gambit: Opponents are already attacking Mr,,
7058, Rubio in New Hampshire for taking a lackadaisical approach there,,
7058," And The New Hampshire Union Leader, an influential newspaper in the state, which has endorsed Mr",,
7058," Christie, accused Mr",,
7058, Rubio of â€œjust going through the motionsâ€ù in his visits to the state,,
7058,"Presidential campaigns struggle every cycle with the question of how many resources to commit to states they stand little chance of winning, and the consequences are not always straightforward",,
7058," In 2008, Senator John McCain of Arizona spent relatively little time campaigning in Iowa and watched his poll numbers plummet, but then came back to win in New Hampshire and capture the Republican nomination",,
7058," In 2012, Mitt Romneyâ€™s campaign agonized over whether to compete in Iowa, only to decide right before Thanksgiving in 2011 â€” a little more than a month before the caucuses â€” that he would",,
7058,"â€œSpreading your forces out over a wide front would make me very nervous,â€ù said Stuart Stevens, Mr",,

7058, â€œAnd thatâ€™s the hardest thing,,
7058, Youâ€™ve got to decide where youâ€™re going to live and where youâ€™re going to die,,
7058,â€ùThe question of where Mr,,
7058, Rubio can win that will provide his campaign with the early bounce it needs to prove he is able to win the nomination is coming up more and more as he travels the country,,
7058,"When he ventured an answer recently in West Des Moines, he did not display much interest in entertaining what he clearly considered an abstract question at this point",,
7058,"â€œIâ€™m not a psychic,â€ù he said, adding that he was confident in his strategy",,

7059,"]After New York City and Amazon went to war over a new campus in Queens, the city is heading into battle with another tech giant: Uber",,
7059,"Mayor Bill de Blasio approved a yearlong cap on Uber vehicles last summer, making New York the first major American city to rein in the booming ride-hail company",,
7059, Now Mr,,
7059," de Blasio wants to extend the cap, prompting Uber to sue the city last week to overturn the law",,
7059,"Uber has fiercely opposed the cap, arguing that it hurts New Yorkers who rely on the app, especially outside Manhattan where there are fewer transit options",,
7059," The lawsuit called the cityâ€™s regulatory approach â€œunfortunate, irresponsible and irrational",,
7059,â€ùMr,,
7059," de Blasio, a Democrat with presidential ambitions, responded by saying the cityâ€™s new rules â€” both the cap and a measure to raise wages for drivers â€” were needed",,
7059,"â€œNo legal challenge changes the fact that Uber made congestion on our roads worse and paid their drivers less than a living wage,â€ù said Seth Stein, a spokesman for the mayor",,
7059, â€œThe cityâ€™s new laws aim to change that,,
7059,"â€ùLike many other cities across the world, New York is struggling to respond to the explosive growth of the ride-hailing industry",,
7059," The influx of vehicles has raised concerns about street congestion, working conditions for drivers, the decimation of the yellow cab industry and the siphoning of riders from public transit",,
7059,"The lawsuit comes at a critical moment for Uber and its main competitor, Lyft, as both companies rush to go public",,
7059," Uber, which could be valued as high as $120 billion, is likely to be one of the biggest-ever public offerings by a tech company",,
7059,"The two ride-hail companies have bristled over new regulations in New York, Uberâ€™s largest market in the United States",,
7059, Lyft recently sued to stop the rules aimed at raising driver pay,,
7059,Uber and Lyft are also battling each other to dominate New Yorkâ€™s thriving bike markets,,
7059," Lyft bought Motivate, the company that operates CitiBike, the cityâ€™s popular bike-share program",,
7059, Uber bought another bike company called Jump and began offering electric bikes in the Bronx and Staten Island,,
7059,"Uber supports the driver pay rules, but argued that the cap hurts drivers who want to join its app",,
7059,"â€œIt is disappointing to see the de Blasio administration remain singularly focused on a cap that evidence suggests is doing nothing to relieve congestion while preventing thousands of New Yorkers from earning a living wage,â€ù Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement",,
7059,Some business leaders worry that Amazonâ€™s decision to abandon its deal with New York could hurt the cityâ€™s image as a tech hub,,
7059,"But Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said the struggle with Uber is not a tech issue â€” itâ€™s about worsening street traffic",,
7059,"â€œWeâ€™re not really afraid of being branded anti-tech,â€ù Ms",,
7059, Gelinas said,,
7059," â€œIn the long term, our problem is how do we deal with all of this growth â€” and not the risk that weâ€™re going to drive away that growth with a little bit of rhetoric and a little regulation",,
7059,â€ùMr,,
7059, de Blasio has a bitter history with Uber,,
7059," When the mayor first proposed a cap in 2015, Uber launched an aggressive attack, introducing a â€œde Blasio viewâ€ù in the companyâ€™s app to blame him for long wait times",,
7059, Uber won the debate and became shorthand in his administration for an embarrassing defeat,,
7059,"But Uber was on the defensive last year when the cap idea was revived by Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker",,
7059, Uberâ€™s reputation had been harmed by accusations of gender discrimination and other scandals,,
7059, It hired a new chief executive and a new leader for New York to try to improve its image,,
7059,"The number of for-hire vehicles in the city has surged to more than 100,000 vehicles, from about 60,000 in 2015",,
7059," But while Uber and other companies are flourishing, many of their drivers are not",,
7059," About 40 percent of drivers have incomes so low that they qualify for Medicaid and about 18 percent qualify for food stamps, according to a study by prominent economists last year",,
7059,The cap was expected to last a year while the city studied the proliferation of ride-hail trips,,
7059," At the end of that period, the cityâ€™s taxi commission would review the number of vehicle licenses and decide on how they would be regulated",,
7059,"Last month, Mr",,
7059," de Blasio said in a radio interview that he wanted to ""put ongoing caps in place on the for-hire vehicles",,
7059,â€ù Officials at City Hall confirmed that the mayor was considering extending the cap,,
7059,Uberâ€™s lawsuit argues that it was not legal for the city to delegate the power to cap vehicles to the taxi commission,,
7059," If Uber cannot meet growing rider demand, the lawsuit says that could hurt the stateâ€™s efforts to raise money for the subway through new fees on ride-hail trips",,
7059,"The lawsuit, filed in state supreme court in Manhattan, questions the cityâ€™s motives: â€œThis is less a â€˜studyâ€™ and more a â€˜post hoc rationalizationâ€™ of a remedy the city appears to have already selected",,
7059,â€ùLyft also opposes a permanent cap,,
7059," â€œAny extension of this misguided policy would do even more significant, long-term damage to drivers and riders,â€ù Lyft said in a statement",,
7059,"The City Council is proud of the new regulations imposed on the ride-hailing industry and had the authority to approve them, said Jacob Tugendrajch, a spokesman for Mr",,
7059, Johnson,,
7059," The speaker, his office said, wants the taxi commission to make a decision about any future limits on vehicles based on data from its study",,
7059,"The cityâ€™s taxi commissioner, Meera Joshi, recently announced that she was stepping down in March",,
7059, Her successor will have a powerful role in determining the industryâ€™s future,,
7059,"In a separate lawsuit, Lyft challenged the cityâ€™s rules to raise driver wages to more than $17 an hour",,
7059," Lyft claims the rules give Uber an unfair advantage because it judges companies differently based on their â€œutilization rate,â€ù or how often drivers have a passenger in their car versus driving around empty",,
7059,"The approach gives â€œthe largest company with the biggest market share a built-in and perpetual advantage over companies with lower utilizations,â€ù Lyftâ€™s lawsuit said",,
7059,Lyft has sold itself as the more ethical ride-hail option,,
7059," But the lawsuit hurt its image among some riders like Brad Lander, a councilman from Brooklyn, who said he deleted the app",,
7059,"After facing harsh criticism, Lyft announced that it would comply with the new pay rules while its legal case proceeded",,
7059,"Uber and Lyft say they care about public policy, but the lawsuits show their first priority is self interest, said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who has closely studied the industry",,
7059, The companies face a difficult challenge of balancing both profits and their public image,,
7059," In this case, Mr",,
7059," Schaller said, Uber chose to protect its bottom line",,
7059,â€œUber in particular has been playing super nice since its change in management a year ago and particularly as they get closer to the I,,
7059,P,,
7059,O,,
7059,",â€ù he said",,
7059, â€œSuing the biggest city in the country isnâ€™t playing super nice,,
7059,â€ù,,
7060,You may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels,,
7060,"Over the last two years, lawmakers and the public around the globe have been awakened to fears about the expanding powers of the largest technology companies, particularly the ones Iâ€™ve called the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, the most valuable companies on the American markets",,
7060,The concerns span the gamut,,
7060, There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations,,
7060," Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth",,
7060, Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products,,
7060,"In different ways, the companies have conceded some of these fears and have vowed to address them",,
7060," Taking stock, cleaning up, admitting â€œmoral responsibilityâ€ù for their contributions to society â€” these are the buzzwords of a tech ecosystem that is supposedly subsumed by remorse and committed to rehabilitation",,
7060,Yet there is something deeply incongruous at the heart of the supposed â€œtechlashâ€ù: It is not really making a huge dent in the tech giantsâ€™ financial performance,,
7060," Over the last two weeks, each of the five reported earnings that were brimming with mostly fantastic news for its investors",,
7060," Amazon, which has long conditioned shareholders to expect a lot of growth but not much earnings, reported a record profit",,
7060," Microsoft and Googleâ€™s parent company, Alphabet, both handily beat Wall Streetâ€™s projections",,
7060," On Tuesday, so did Apple; if its price jumps as a result, it could become the first company to reach a market valuation of more than $1 trillion",,
7060,"Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?In a strange way, the social networkâ€™s troubles only underscored its dominance",,
7060," Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss",,
7060, Thatâ€™s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook,,
7060, Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future,,
7060,"â€œThis is one of the most profitable business models Iâ€™ve ever seen, and that really hasnâ€™t changed,â€ù said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital",,
7060, He added that Facebookâ€™s stock now â€œmay be the single most attractively priced asset across technology,,
7060,â€ùTogether the earning statements tell a clear story,,
7060," Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, arenâ€™t having a substantial impact",,
7060," To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business",,
7060,"Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top",,
7060,"Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate",,
7060," That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazonâ€™s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion",,
7060,"Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits",,
7060," And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now theyâ€™ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry",,
7060," In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2",,
7060,5 billion profit,,
7060," Thatâ€™s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money",,
7060,Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software,,
7060," Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazonâ€™s servers rather than locally",,
7060," Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazonâ€™s site",,
7060,"For rival retailers, Amazonâ€™s new profitability constitutes a kind of nightmare scenario",,
7060," By shuttling profits from software into its retail business, Amazon can keep expanding its store at a breakneck pace",,
7060,"â€œThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin â€” and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,â€ù said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey",,
7060,But itâ€™s not just Amazon thatâ€™s profiting under the venture capitalist Marc Andreessenâ€™s thesis that â€œsoftware is eating the world,,
7060,"â€ù Microsoftâ€™s surging earnings were also driven by its cloud business, while Appleâ€™s software services â€” things like sales of apps, music subscriptions, cloud storage and Apple Pay â€” are the fastest-growing part of its business",,
7060,The European Union recently fined Google $5,,
7060,"1 billion for abusing its mobile software monopoly, which followed a $2",,
7060,7 billion fine last year for abuse of its search monopoly,,
7060, (Google is appealing both decisions,,
7060,) Apple agreed last year to pay nearly $16 billion in back taxes to the European Union over its cozy tax deal with Ireland,,
7060, (The funds will be held in escrow while Ireland appeals the decision; Apple has disputed any wrongdoing,,
7060,") Facebook, which has been hauled before lawmakers in Europe and the United States for its role in politics, faces threats of increased regulation and possible fines for mishandling private data",,
7060,But Big Techâ€™s earnings so far donâ€™t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny,,
7060, Google paid its fine and still reported a $3,,
7060,2 billion quarterly profit,,
7060," Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europeâ€™s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation",,
7060, Facebookâ€™s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there),,
7060," Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals",,
7060,There is also the possibility that regulatory zeal will abate,,
7060," Google watchers say itâ€™s notable that President Trump tweeted criticism of the European Unionâ€™s fine against Google, suggesting, perhaps, that American regulators wonâ€™t take up a similar case",,
7060," (Of course, it is hard these days to really know how much to read into a presidential tweet",,
7060,")Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists",,
7060, Amazonâ€™s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook â€” which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the governmentâ€™s help,,
7060,"â€œThereâ€™s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,â€ù Mr",,
7060, Mahaney said,,
7060," â€œNow itâ€™s going to be a triopoly â€” but if you were worried about the duopoly, youâ€™re probably saying, â€˜Couldnâ€™t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?â€™â€ùFinally, there are what Mr",,
7060, Mahaney calls the â€œgreen fieldsâ€ù â€” the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses,,
7060,"Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties â€” Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them â€” are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them",,
7060," At Google, thereâ€™s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years",,
7060,And thatâ€™s just in the short term,,
7060," The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars",,
7060,"â€œThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,â€ù Mr",,
7060, Squali said,,
7060," â€œThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and theyâ€™re not afraid to destroy something thatâ€™s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them",,
7060,â€ùIn other words: Get used to the Five,,
7060, Theyâ€™re not going anywhere,,
7061,The Yankees faced elimination at home against an upstart team and a dominant pitcher on three daysâ€™ rest,,
7061," It felt like 2003, except this time at the start of the postseason, not the very end",,
7061," Dallas Keuchel played the role of Josh Beckett in Tuesdayâ€™s wild-card game in the Bronx, and now the Yankeesâ€™ season is over",,
7061,"The Houston Astros bounced around on the Yankee Stadium grass, surviving baseballâ€™s knockout round with a 3-0 victory and earning a division series date with the Kansas City Royals",,
7061," Those teams combined for 197 losses just three years ago, and now they will play for a spot in the American League Championship Series",,
7061,"Twelve Octobers ago, it was Beckett and the Marlins clinching the World Series at the old Stadium, squeezing the life from the Yankees and muting their fans",,
7061," The Yankees responded with a late-winter trade for Alex Rodriguez, who has helped them reach the playoffs nine times",,
7061,"Rodriguez led the Yankees to a title in 2009, and in all his other postseasons with the team, he has hit ",,
7061,202,,
7061," He was 0 for 4 on Tuesday, and Keuchel retired him with runners in scoring position to end the first and sixth innings",,
7061," Rodriguez, 40, had a strong comeback season, but the Yankeesâ€™ utter dependence on him â€” especially against left-handers after Mark Teixieraâ€™s broken leg â€” was their failing, not his",,
7061,"â€œThe way this team played here down the stretch isnâ€™t reflective of what this team looked like for most of the season,â€ù General Manager Brian Cashman said",,
7061, â€œThatâ€™s the frustrating part,,
7061, The wheels were flying off as the season went on,,
7061," The longer it went, for some reason, the worse we started to get",,
7061,"â€ùThis was the season of A-Rod, whose return from a yearlong drug suspension was not as awkward as we expected",,
7061," He said the right things and hit very well, and when he faded at the end, the team did, too",,
7061," No championship, but all things considered, a successful season",,
7061,"â€œI donâ€™t think a lot of people thought we would be able to play in this game,â€ù right fielder Carlos Beltran said",,
7061, â€œWeâ€™ve got to consider this a success,,
7061,"â€ùThey kept business humming, too, even without a season-long farewell for a beloved, grizzled champion",,
7061," While missing the playoffs in 2013, the Yankees said goodbye to Mariano Rivera",,
7061," Last season, it was Derek Jeter",,
7061,"This season? Attendance and ratings fell, but that was all relative",,
7061, The Yankees led the A,,
7061,L,,
7061," in ticket sales for the 13th season in a row, and the YES Network remains an industry model",,
7061," There was enough star power, and enough victories (87) to keep the fans engaged, even with the Mets rising again in Queens",,
7061,"Even if the Yankees wanted to, they could never retrench",,
7061, They are blessed and burdened by a philosophy that demands they always go for it,,
7061,"There are limits, of course â€” they would not give a 10-year contract to Robinson Cano two years ago, or part with Luis Severino, Greg Bird and Aaron Judge at the July trading deadline",,
7061," They have five starting pitchers under age 30: Severino, Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda, Nathan Eovaldi and Ivan Nova",,
7061,But no A,,
7061,L,,
7061," team outspends the Yankees, or seems likely to do so in the near future",,
7061,"â€œWeâ€™re going to have the pieces to compete to win it all,â€ù closer Andrew Miller said",,
7061, â€œItâ€™s just up to us to go out there and do it,,
7061,"â€ùThe Astros played on the same field Tuesday, for the same stakes, while illustrating the other extreme of team-building",,
7061, Houston got here by undergoing an aggressive teardown that was timed perfectly with baseballâ€™s new collective bargaining agreement,,
7061,That deal went through in November 2011,,
7061," The next month, the Astrosâ€™ new owner, Jim Crane, hired Jeff Luhnow as general manager",,
7061," Luhnow, who had built a strong farm system with the St",,
7061," Louis Cardinals, started fresh",,
7061,"â€œLetâ€™s forget about how we got here, why we got here, letâ€™s forget about whatâ€™s normally done in the industry,â€ù he said, recalling his strategy",,
7061, â€œLetâ€™s take that blank piece of paper and figure out whatâ€™s a good way to do it,,
7061," Itâ€™s not possible in all markets, I realize that",,
7061,â€ùWhat he meant was the losing,,
7061," Not intentional losing, Luhnow and the teamâ€™s president for business operations, Reid Ryan, insisted",,
7061, But the inevitable losing that would come with a disciplined rebuilding plan would never work in the Bronx,,
7061,"â€œAnytime you change rules, thereâ€™s going to be somebody thatâ€™s going to figure out how to do things a little bit better,â€ù Luhnow said",,
7061, â€œThat coincided with us taking over in Houston and having the first pick and the largest pool and thinking creatively about how to allocate those resources,,
7061,"â€ùThe rules, for the first time, allowed the worst teams to have the largest pool of money to spend in the amateur draft and international free agency",,
7061," The Astros were coming off the majorsâ€™ worst record in 2011 (56-106), and soon it got worse: a 55-107 mark in 2012, and then 51-111 in 2013",,
7061,"With a flood of resources and high picks, the Astros gathered a deep prospect pool that has included Carlos Correa, the rookie shortstop who batted third on Tuesday, and young starter Lance McCullers Jr",,
7061," By giving multiyear auditions to players they inherited from the farm system, the Astros found a gem in Keuchel",,
7061,â€œJ,,
7061,D,,
7061," Martinez went onto another organization and had success, so it wasnâ€™t perfect by any stretch,â€ù Luhnow said, referring to the outfielder who has blossomed with Detroit after the Astros released him",,
7061, â€œBut we were able to evaluate our own inventory fairly effectively and continue to build the young talent in high quantity,,
7061,"â€ùThe Astros spent for bullpen help last winter, signing Pat Neshek and Luke Gregerson and also bidding for Miller",,
7061," They added payroll in July with deals for Scott Kazmir, Mike Fiers and Carlos Gomez",,
7061,"But the years of losing, and a troubled TV deal that limited Astrosâ€™ broadcasts to around 10,000 homes until this season, made an impact",,
7061,"â€œThe setbacks this organization had with the amount of 100-loss seasons and not being on television really hurt the club,â€ù Ryan said",,
7061," â€œBut I think surprisingly, to fans, itâ€™s bounced back",,
7061," Now, look, weâ€™re not there yet",,
7061, We need to get back to being good and drawing a lot of people and having one of the best organizations,,
7061, But this was a breakout year,,
7061,"â€ùAbout half the homes in their region can now watch the Astros on TV, Ryan said, and attendance has risen by almost 7,000 per game since 2012, to an average of 26,587",,
7061," That is far below the Yankeesâ€™ standards, but trust is returning between the fans and the organization",,
7061,"â€œPeople have responded to this team in Houston,â€ù Ryan said, â€œbecause folks have gotten to make an emotional connection with our guys",,
7061,â€ùThe Astros will never spend like the Yankees,,
7061," They were 29th in payroll on opening day this season, at just under $71 million, and eventually they should sit around the middle of teams in payroll",,
7061,"That is quite enough to win, though, in an era when the competition is tougher, and the rules are designed to give teams like the Astros and the Royals a pathway to success",,
7061," The Yankees keep doing it their way â€” without the deep valleys, but without the peaks, either",,
7062,Itâ€™s hard to overstate how deeply Americans despised their governmentâ€™s response to the global financial crisis,,
7062," It has helped shape the last decade of American politics, fueling distrust of powerful institutions and speeding a drift toward ideological extremes",,
7062,"But for all that anger, the engineers of the American crisis response got the economics mostly correct, and more right than most of those â€” including leading economic thinkers and prominent politicians â€” who were second-guessing them",,
7062,"I was a beat reporter covering the events at the time and the key players â€” including the former Treasury secretaries Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner, and the former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke â€” and then wrote a book on the crisis",,
7062," Looking back on it a decade later, Iâ€™m struck by the way that I, and they, misunderstood what â€œsuccessâ€ù would actually mean",,
7062,"The engineers of the response succeeded in their immediate goal, to preserve the financial system",,
7062," But they â€” or, more precisely, they and their political leaders at the time â€” also left fissures that threaten to undermine the system they sought to preserve",,
7062, The very underpinnings of modern capitalism are being questioned from all sides,,
7062," A Republican administration has gleefully cast aside trade deals, for instance, and the energy among Democrats is around democratic socialism",,
7062,"To understand the challenges and ultimately the failure of the politics of their response, it helps to put yourself back in 2008 and 2009, when the financial might of the United States government â€” trillions of dollars, cumulatively â€” was deployed to try to contain the crisis",,
7062,Mr,,
7062," Geithner, Mr",,
7062, Paulson and Mr,,
7062," Bernanke are centrists in the context of modern American politics, but they are conservatives in the traditional sense â€” people trying to preserve a system they inherited",,
7062,Their strategy was to patch things up as quickly as possible,,
7062," The goal was not to try to reinvent Wall Street on the fly, but to keep the flow of capital coursing through the global economy while minimizing the depth and duration of the recession that the crisis had caused",,
7062,Some 230 academic economists signed a letter attacking the bank bailout legislation that Mr,,
7062, Paulson proposed as unfair and a potential threat to the vibrancy of private markets,,
7062,Mr,,
7062, Geithnerâ€™s disinclination to nationalize banks drew fierce criticism from liberals who argued that the government was essentially funneling money to banks with little assurance they would resume lending,,
7062,"â€œWhatever its merits, his bailout plan offers generous subsidies to banks and private investors while protecting bank management and creditors,â€ù John B",,
7062, Judis wrote in 2009 in a New Republic article titled â€œThe Geithner Disaster,,
7062,â€ùMr,,
7062, Bernankeâ€™s efforts to pump money into the economy by buying up bonds also met opposition,,
7062," A group of conservative economists wrote a letter in 2010 arguing that the Fedâ€™s plans to engage in quantitative easing â€œrisk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fedâ€™s objective of promoting employment",,
7062,â€ùThese attacks were misguided,,
7062,Mr,,
7062, Paulsonâ€™s financial rescue package did not herald an era of socialism on Wall Street; nor did it come at a huge continuing cost to taxpayers,,
7062," By many measures, it made money",,
7062,Mr,,
7062, Geithnerâ€™s stress tests achieved their goal of restoring confidence in major banks without the cost and political damage of nationalizing them,,
7062, They were successful enough that similar stress tests are now a part of regulatorsâ€™ tool kits both in the United States and overseas,,
7062,Mr,,
7062, Bernankeâ€™s aggressive monetary policy probably played a role in getting the expansion on track starting in mid-2009,,
7062, Quantitative easing and low interest rates did not cause a collapse of the dollar or spiraling inflation,,
7062,"Nobody would argue that the United States economy is perfect, or that the policymakers got everything exactly right",,
7062,If Mr,,
7062," Paulson had secured financial rescue legislation before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, perhaps the most severe phase of the crisis could have been avoided altogether, though it is a puzzle how he could have gotten the votes for such a plan before the crisis became more severe",,
7062, If Mr,,
7062, Bernanke had moved faster â€” putting an open-ended quantitative easing program in place in 2009 or 2010 instead of waiting till 2012 â€” maybe full recovery would have come sooner,,
7062,Itâ€™s not clear how the recovery might have looked had Mr,,
7062," Geithner embraced a more activist approach to replacing management and taking greater government control of the most troubled large banks, notably Citigroup and Bank of America",,
7062, Or if he had welcomed a larger program to help relieve borrowers who were underwater on their homes,,
7062,"The tactics the men chose can be second-guessed, but the result of their efforts speaks for itself",,
7062," The expansion has lasted nine years, the second longest on record",,
7062," Although job gains were disappointingly slow for years, the unemployment rate is now 3",,
7062,"9 percent, among the lowest in decades",,
7062,"From 2007 to 2017, per-person inflation-adjusted G",,
7062,D,,
7062,P,,
7062, rose 6,,
7062,"3 percent in the United States, compared with only 3 percent in the eurozone, where similar policies were embraced more slowly",,
7062,"In exhaustive research of the history of financial crises, the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff found that it takes eight years on average for a society to return to its level of per-person income",,
7062," The United States did so in 2013, only six years after the peak of the crisis",,
7062,It was Feb,,
7062," 19, 2009, less than a month into the Obama administration",,
7062, Mr,,
7062," Geithner and his colleagues had introduced plans to assist struggling homeowners, which many liberal critics considered deeply inadequate",,
7062,The human cost of the foreclosure crisis was indeed immense; there were 2,,
7062,8 million foreclosures that year alone,,
7062, But the politics of helping troubled homeowners were more toxic than the crisis managers had foreseen,,
7062,"From the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CNBC broadcaster Rick Santelli began a rant for the ages",,
7062, â€œHow many of you people want to pay for your neighborâ€™s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and canâ€™t pay their bills?â€ù Mr,,
7062," Santelli said, as traders cheered behind him",,
7062," â€œPresident Obama, are you listening?â€ùâ€œWeâ€™re thinking about having a Chicago tea party in July,â€ù he continued",,
7062,"The term stuck, and was embraced by the conservative activists who propelled Republicans to victory in the 2010 midterm elections â€” driven, in no small part, by opposition to economic stimulus, financial bailouts and the work of the Federal Reserve",,
7062,The policymakers knew historyâ€™s warnings about economic policy that reacts too sluggishly to financial crisis,,
7062,Mr,,
7062, Geithner spent some evenings in the darkest days reading in Liaquat Ahamedâ€™s â€œLords of Financeâ€ù about how an earlier generation of policymakers bungled the response to the Great Depression,,
7062, Mr,,
7062, Bernanke is a scholar of that era in his own right,,
7062,"But they seemed to assume that if they got the economics right, popular support would follow",,
7062, As Mr,,
7062," Bernanke wrote in his memoir about the Santelli rant, â€œI remained perplexed that helping homeowners was not more politically popular",,
7062,"â€ùThereâ€™s a reason, of course, that they were in their roles as appointed technocrats and not politicians",,
7062, But it isnâ€™t clear that George W,,
7062, Bush or Barack Obama had any better ideas for bringing along the public than did the men they chose to lead financial policy,,
7062, The crisis response may well have been a Rubikâ€™s Cube of political and economic challenges too complicated to solve,,
7062,"It was foreseeable, perhaps, that many on the left would view the Geithner-Paulson-Bernanke strategy as too friendly to Wall Street interests",,
7062, It was also foreseeable that the libertarian right would loathe the bailouts,,
7062, More surprising were the ways in which some of the biggest beneficiaries of the strategy became vocal opponents,,
7062,"The Geithner strategy was based on rescuing Wall Street, using hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars â€” while building a more rigorous regulatory system to try to prevent a similar crisis",,
7062,"But by the time what became the Dodd-Frank Act was on its way to passage in 2010, the financial industry and nearly all Republicans in Congress had committed to all-out opposition of industry regulation",,
7062," Only three of 178 Republican House members, for example, supported the bill",,
7062,Even as Mr,,
7062," Bernankeâ€™s easy money policies pushed the stock market upward and coincided with a gradually improving economy and low inflation, the drumbeat of commentary was overwhelmingly negative",,
7062,You could turn on a financial network at nearly any hour of the trading day and hear complaints about how quantitative easing and zero interest rates were distorting markets,,
7062, When Mr,,
7062," Bernanke left office in early 2014, when the stock market was soaring and the unemployment rate was falling fast, only 28 percent of Republicans approved of his performance, according to a Gallup survey",,
7062,Success has rarely been so unpopular,,
7062,"In July, Mr",,
7062," Bernanke, Mr",,
7062, Geithner and Mr,,
7062, Paulson were together again,,
7062," They invited a handful of reporters to interview them in a conference room at the Brookings Institution, where they will be participating in a crisis retrospective in September",,
7062,Might the rise of anti-establishment parties around the world â€” not least Donald J,,
7062," Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders-esque socialists on the left in the United States â€” be traced to their work as crisis responders?â€œWe know from history that financial crises, particularly big ones, do tend to get followed by a populist reaction,â€ù Mr",,
7062, Bernanke said,,
7062," â€œI think we all tried our best to explain what we were doing and work with the politics, as difficult as it was",,
7062," I think back to the crisis, we were very focused on preventing the collapse of the financial system",,
7062, And developing our communication to the broad public wasnâ€™t always our first priority,,
7062,"â€ùHe argued, though, that longer-term trends â€” like stagnation in middle-class wages, social dysfunctions, rising mistrust in government and hostility to immigration â€” were a bigger explanation for the rise in a politics of extremes",,
7062,This analysis seems both correct and incomplete,,
7062," Of course, the embrace of anti-immigrant nationalism on the right and of socialism on the left have roots considerably deeper than a bank bailout or a quantitative easing program",,
7062,"But it was the experience of the crisis, and the sense among Americans of all ideological dispositions that they were being asked to foot the bill for someone elseâ€™s mistakes â€” whether by Wall Street C",,
7062,E,,
7062,O,,
7062,s or by Mr,,
7062, Santelliâ€™s neighbor with the renovated bathroom â€” that helped make those long-simmering problems boil over,,
7062,"The response to the crisis was in many ways the high-water mark for a mold of centrist, technocratic policymaking that seeks to tweak and nudge existing institutions toward better outcomes",,
7062, It also undermined any widespread popular support for that mode of governing for the foreseeable future,,
7062,"It turns out, when you throw trillions of dollars at rescuing a system that most people donâ€™t like very much in the first place, the result isnâ€™t relief",,
7062,Itâ€™s anger,,

7064,C,,
7064, â€” Throwback paint schemes on racecars and retro logos and signs welcomed Nascar fans when they arrived at Darlington Raceway this weekend for the Bojanglesâ€™ Southern 500 Sprint Cup race,,
7064, The marketing campaign was designed to make one of the most storied tracks on the circuit look like the early 1970s all over again,,
7064,"Fans were more than happy to complete the picture, much to Nascarâ€™s dismay",,
7064, The Confederate flags they raised on R,,
7064,V,,
7064,"s across the infield and outside the track dotted the sky above Darlington on Friday morning, as they have for decades here",,
7064," The Southern 500, after all, was long known for playing â€œDixieâ€ù as its anthem and used to feature a character named Johnny Reb â€” a man dressed as a Confederate soldier who stood atop the winning car with a rebel flag",,
7064,"As those Confederate flags waved once more on Friday, Nascar faced its recurring quandary: How could a sport so closely associated with its Southern roots broaden its appeal nationally without alienating that base?â€œIâ€™d say weâ€™re always looking to make sure weâ€™re satisfying our core fans and our long-term fan at the same time as we are growing to a new audience,â€ù Jim Cassidy, Nascarâ€™s senior vice president for racing operations, said Thursday during a telephone interview",,
7064, â€œItâ€™s a balance,,
7064,"â€ùAnd Darlington Raceway, as much as any track on the circuit, epitomizes the struggle Nascar has faced in trying to find that balance with an event that holds a special place in racing history",,
7064,The Southern 500 was first held at Darlington on Labor Day weekend in 1950,,
7064," For 53 years, it was an iconic stop on the schedule, revered by some as much or more than the Daytona 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 among the most important races of the year",,
7064," That was until 2004, when Nascar changed the schedule to give the Labor Day weekend date to its sister track in Fontana, Calif",,
7064,", in the coveted Los Angeles market",,
7064,The Southern 500 was suddenly gone,,
7064,"â€œItâ€™s one of those things: Be careful what you wish for,â€ù said Kyle Petty, the longtime driver who is now an NBC broadcaster",,
7064," â€œWe wished for a bigger sport, we dreamed of a bigger sport",,
7064," We dreamed of Chicago and Kansas and Dallas, Tex",,
7064,", and L",,
7064,A,,
7064,", and we dreamed of those markets when we were running North Wilkesboro and Darlington and Rockingham and Martinsville and places like that",,
7064,"â€œAnd then all of the sudden you have those markets, but thereâ€™s a sacrifice to be made to be in those markets",,
7064," And I think Nascar looked at it and said, letâ€™s change some of this stuff around",,
7064, I give them credit for changing it at the time to try to make something happen,,
7064, But I give them huge credit for realizing what we had was just as special and coming back to it,,
7064,"â€ùDarlington retained one race each season, the date shifting on the schedule several times",,
7064, The Southern 500 name was brought back in 2009 as well,,
7064,Â But it was not until after the California experiment failed and the Labor Day event was shifted to Atlanta for four years that Nascar finally gave Darlington back its Southern 500 on Labor Day weekend this year,,
7064,"Â It was hard to gauge enthusiasm going into the weekend; the race was not a sellout at the 58,000-seat track",,
7064,"â€œI think our great race fans in South Carolina support this racetrack,â€ù said the track president, Chip Wile",,
7064," â€œCertainly, we want to make a big splash in our return to Labor Day weekend, and I think weâ€™ll do that",,
7064,â€ùBut officials are determined not to make a scene at the same time with Confederate flags in clear view during the race broadcast,,
7064," After all, the Nascar chairman, Brian France, had declared that Confederate flags were no longer welcome at tracks after a mass shooting at a church in Charleston in June",,
7064," When the series shifted to Daytona in July, track officials came up with an exchange program",,
7064, They offered American flags to replace the Confederate flags there,,
7064,Wile said the same program would be in place at Darlington as well,,
7064," Thatâ€™s not exactly what happened on Friday, though, as track workers asked fans to take down their flags",,
7064, The reason given: They blocked sight lines across the track,,
7064,Fans were not buying it,,
7064,"â€œIf theyâ€™re saying it gets in the way, people canâ€™t see across the track, how come they got flags on all the racecar driversâ€™ haulers?â€ù said Tyler Harris, 24, of Reidsville, N",,
7064,C,,
7064,", pointing to the many American flags that still waved",,
7064,Harris had displayed five Confederate flags on a 30-foot pole attached to an R,,
7064,V,,
7064, in the infield,,
7064, The flag on top included this line: â€œI Aint Coming Down,,
7064,â€ù But it did come down Friday morning after track workers fanned out across the infield and asked fans to remove them,,
7064, Harris vowed to put the flags back up,,
7064,"Brian Myers, 40, of Ridgeville, S",,
7064,C,,
7064,", came to Darlington in a blue-painted school bus with a sign on front that said, â€œRidgeville Rednecks",,
7064,"â€ù He was asked to take his flag down, too",,
7064," He wasnâ€™t happy about it, though",,
7064,"â€œThereâ€™s a lot of newer, younger people coming to the races now, not the old school,â€ù Myers said",,
7064, â€œTheyâ€™ve got to keep everybody happy,,
7064, So theyâ€™re in a tough spot,,
7064, I understand that,,
7064, But they shouldnâ€™t ask us to take our flags down,,
7064,â€ù,,
7066,"In recent months, low oil prices and volatile stock prices have led some oil rich nations to sell stocks to raise cash and reduce the riskiness of their holdings",,
7066," According to the Financial Times, redemptions from Saudi Arabia totaling an estimated $50 billion to $70 billion (and possibly more) caught some asset management firms off guard last month, with one describing a day of large Saudi withdrawals as Ã¢Â€Âœour black Monday",,
7066,"Ã¢Â€ÂùBut for all the danger implied by that phrase, little is known about potential risks in the changing size and mix of foreign reserves and other investments from state-run funds that manage sovereign wealth",,
7066,Unexpected transactions are a reminder that many sovereign wealth funds are secretive about their holdings and strategies,,
7066," This opacity is a problem because it can breed and amplify volatility, but it persists despite international efforts by finance officials and investor groups to create rules on transparency",,
7066," Persian Gulf funds, in particular, which hold about one fourth of the roughly $7 trillion in sovereign wealth funds, tend to be opaque",,
7066," In a ranking of transparency and accountability compiled by Edwin Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, funds in Qatar, Oman and Brunei are near the bottom, as are two of several funds from the United Arab Emirates",,
7066," Even the sovereign wealth fund of Kuwait, which has the highest rank among its Middle East peers, is less transparent than funds in Norway (which tops the list), Australia, Canada, Singapore and seven other countries",,
7066,"The pressures on oil rich nations are also a reminder that large asset managers with ties to sovereign funds Ã¢Â€Â” including BlackRock, the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest asset manager Ã¢Â€Â” are not regulated as Ã¢Â€Âœsystemically important financial institutionsÃ¢Â€Âù or Ã¢Â€Âœsifis",,
7066,"Ã¢Â€Âù The sifi designation, imposed by financial regulators, means that an institution would likely pose a threat to the financial system if it were to founder",,
7066," Accordingly, sifis Ã¢Â€Â” which include the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s biggest banks Ã¢Â€Â” are held to higher regulatory standards than non-sifis",,
7066,Regulators decided not to treat large asset management firms as sifis after considerable debate and after vigorous lobbying by firms that were eager to avoid heightened regulation,,
7066,Did regulators make the right call? Perhaps,,
7066, But it is hard to be sanguine as huge and often secretive sovereign investors interact with huge and relatively unregulated asset managers in an unusual global context of prolonged low oil prices,,
7066, A lesson of the financial crisis is that interconnections among financial players that are stable in one context can become unstable as circumstances change,,
7066,Do regulators understand the linkages Ã¢Â€Â” financial and economic Ã¢Â€Â” that will be tested if oil prices remain low or fall further? Reassurances are few and risks are many,,

7067,"â€œSee things as they are,â€ù suggested Ven Indacara, a student monk in Yangon, as we sat together last week, legs tucked under us, on the cool, shaded, tiled walkways that run between the hundreds of shrines scattered below the glowing, gilded Shwedagon Pagoda",,
7067," These past two weeks on the road, weâ€™ve been trying to do just that: take things in, appreciate them for what they are, remember to carry them with us in the future",,
7067, It turns out Myanmar is the perfect place to do just that â€” especially after a frenetic stopover in Hong Kong,,
7067," If Hong Kong is a party, Myanmar is a tranquil meditation room",,
7067,"In the city of Yangon, the largest in Myanmar, and on the plains of Bagan, the ancient city about an hour away, we were drawn to the gold-plated and gilded stupas, or Buddhist shrines",,
7067," Thereâ€™s a jarring juxtaposition of the old and new â€” the temples are routinely renovated, and they stand out against the faded, painted stucco of the neighboring temples that house countless Buddhas â€” and a wonderful acceptance that both must live alongside one another",,
7067," Even the peaceful sound of the wishing trees, hung with ringing bells, send karma throughout the city",,
7067,"Thereâ€™s no shortage of grand gestures to gawk at in Myanmar, but we found the greatest pleasures in getting up very close",,
7067," One morning, meandering the streets of downtown Yangon, we were swept up by the bustling street stalls and sprawling markets, and the chaotic beauty of faded, postcolonial buildings next to apartment blocks cluttered with satellite dishes",,
7067," People-watching is at its best on the Yangon Circular Railway, where a train loop connects Yangon Central with inner-city suburbs, small towns and semi-rural villages",,
7067," Men and women, monks in maroon and nuns in pink and saffron, carry boxes, baskets, bundles and bags to market amid a sea of pineapple, banana and tamarind vendors",,
7067, It takes about three hours to complete the loop,,
7067,"Riding motorbikes along the dusty red roads through Bagan, to Shwesandaw Paya â€” a thousand-year-old, five-terraced wonder nicknamed the â€œSunset Stupaâ€ù for its sweeping views over the plain as the sun goes down â€” we pulled into a narrow dirt road, and up to a tiny temple",,
7067," Lounging at the front was a monk, watching the sunset with a cigarette and a drink (tea, we suspect)",,
7067, â€œIsnâ€™t this paradise?â€ù he said with a smile,,
7067, He asked what we were doing in Bagan and where we came from,,
7067," â€œWeâ€™re from Australia, but we live in New York",,
7067," Weâ€™re traveling around the world looking for inspiration,â€ù we said",,
7067," He paused, and gestured at the setting sun, taking another puff of his cigarette",,

7069," The ruble dropped more than 4 percent against the dollar, and the price of government bonds fell",,
7069,The combined effect is that life will be at least a bit more expensive for Russian companies and consumers,,
7069,"It was one of the worst days for Russiaâ€™s markets since  its 2014 annexation of Crimea, and the rout underscored a simple fact: While Mr",,

7072,"Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Donald J",,
7072," Trumpâ€™s nominee to run the Treasury Department, electrified Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders on Wednesday when he signaled that the mortgage finance giants would finally be allowed to get out from under Washingtonâ€™s thumb",,
7072,"â€œWe got to get Fannie and Freddie out of government ownership,â€ù he told Fox Business",,
7072, â€œIt makes no sense that these are owned by the government and have been controlled by the government for as long as they have,,
7072,â€ùMr,,
7072, Mnuchin is right,,
7072," It has been more than eight years since the federal government took over Fannie and Freddie in the mortgage crisis; as such, they are the last big piece of unfinished business from that era",,
7072,"When the government changed the terms of their bailouts in the summer of 2012 and began expropriating all of Fannieâ€™s and Freddieâ€™s profits every quarter, it seemed as if that unsatisfactory setup would go on forever",,
7072," After all, it is hard for the government to give up a honey pot that has returned over $60 billion more to the Treasury than the companies received from taxpayers during their troubles",,
7072,"Granted, Mr",,
7072, Mnuchin said little about how the administration thinks the nationâ€™s biggest â€œgovernment-sponsored enterprisesâ€ù should be structured,,
7072," That is not surprising, given the complexity of the $6 trillion mortgage market",,
7072,So why did Mr,,
7072, Mnuchinâ€™s comments jazz the markets? Because they revealed a seismic shift in the way these companies are viewed by the new administration,,
7072," In place of the strident, anti-G",,
7072,S,,
7072,E,,
7072," ideology that has dominated the conversation on both the left and the right since the bailout, it looks as if a more pragmatic and positive approach to the companies and their role in the mortgage market is on the way",,
7072,"What that means, in my view, is that the enterprises may be allowed to live a new day rather than continue to be diminished and drained of their profits",,
7072,"This is good news indeed for small lenders who rely so heavily on Fannie and Freddie to buy the mortgages they underwrite, freeing them to repeat the process rather than hold the loans on their balance sheets",,
7072," And when small lenders benefit, borrowers do, too, by having more choices",,
7072,"As executive director of the Community Mortgage Lenders of America, Glen S",,
7072, Corso represents many of the small entities that depend on the liquidity provided by Fannie and Freddie to make their loans,,
7072, He said in an interview that he and his Main Street constituents were extremely encouraged by the comments from Mr,,
7072, Mnuchin,,
7072,"â€œSince 2012, weâ€™ve been advocating for the G",,
7072,S,,
7072,E,,
7072,"s to be reformed, recapitalized and then released from conservatorship,â€ù Mr",,
7072, Corso said,,
7072, â€œWeâ€™re hopeful that is the direction the Trump administration will head in,,
7072,â€ùThat would be an almost total turnabout from the proposals pushed in recent years by housing officials under President Obama and some influential lawmakers,,
7072," Railing against recapitalizing the companies and releasing them from conservatorship, they have put forward an array of complicated and impractical proposals that would have reconfigured the mortgage market and, in some cases, handed over a big chunk of it to the nationâ€™s largest banks",,
7072,"Although there was not much talk of Fannie and Freddie on the campaign trail, it was widely assumed that a Clinton administration would embrace some of those Obama housing officials as well as their ideas",,
7072,That those officials now have little sway is one reason shares in Fannie and Freddie soared in value just after the election and even before Mr,,
7072, Mnuchin spoke about the companies,,
7072,"As a former head of the mortgage-backed securities desk at Goldman Sachs, Mr",,
7072, Mnuchin well understands the mechanics of this enormous market,,
7072, He also recognizes the significant role a well-capitalized Fannie and Freddie could play in ensuring that borrowers have access to mortgage money in good economies as well as bad,,
7072,"So what might happen now? In his comments, Mr",,
7072, Mnuchin nodded to a crucial issue regarding Fannie and Freddie: safety and soundness,,
7072," â€œWeâ€™ll make sure that when theyâ€™re restructured, theyâ€™re absolutely safe and they donâ€™t get taken over again,â€ù he said, â€œBut we got to get them out of government control",,
7072,â€ùA first step in ensuring that Fannie and Freddie are safe would be to let them rebuild their capital,,
7072," Since the government began taking all their profits in 2012, it has directed the companies to operate on a small and shrinking sliver of capital",,
7072," Under the current arrangement, the companies will have zero capital at the end of 2018",,
7072,"This is clearly untenable and unsafe for taxpayers, who would again be on the hook if Fannie and Freddie began losing money",,
7072,An easy way to let them rebuild capital would be to end the quarterly transfer of all their profits to the Treasury,,
7072," This would not require legislation; it could be done administratively with incoming Treasury officials advising the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, to change the terms of the governmentâ€™s agreement with the companies",,
7072, This was supposed to happen anyway while the companies were operating under the conservatorship,,
7072,"What of the fears that if they are allowed to recapitalize, the companies will return to their swaggering, prebailout ways and grow powerful and reckless as they did in the 1990s?Mr",,
7072, Corso and others say safeguards are in place to protect taxpayers from such an outcome,,
7072,â€œWe would be the first to acknowledge that there were serious deficiencies in the way the G,,
7072,S,,
7072,E,,
7072,"s operated, pre-2008,â€ù he said",,
7072, â€œBut a lot have been addressed in the conservatorship,,
7072,"â€ùSimply recapitalizing the companies will also be cleaner, preventing potential self-dealing and the giveaways of the companiesâ€™ assets that existed in some of the privatization proposals",,
7072,"There is another intriguing aspect to the Trump administrationâ€™s shift, and it has to do with the lawsuits that have been filed against the government",,
7072," One such suit was brought by Fairholme Funds, a mutual fund company that owns Fannie and Freddie shares",,
7072, It contends that the 2012 profit sweep was an improper taking of private property without just compensation,,
7072,"For years, Justice Department lawyers have been stonewalling document requests from the plaintiffs",,
7072, The government has requested confidential treatment for thousands of pages of materials and has asserted presidential privilege in 45 documents,,
7072,"Margaret Sweeney, the judge hearing the matter in the Court of Federal Claims, recently opened the door a crack, letting some documents see the light of day",,
7072, Some of the materials cast doubt on arguments made by the governmentâ€™s lawyers that the profit sweep came about because Fannie and Freddie were in dire condition and the taxpayers needed protection from future losses,,
7072,"If Judge Sweeney were to order the release of more documents, the current administration would probably appeal",,
7072," It is not as clear that a Trump administration would do so, however",,
7072, This opens the possibility that all those materials that the Obama administration has fought so hard to keep secret might just emerge,,
7072,That would be a huge service for anyone interested in holding government officials accountable for their actions,,
7073,Coach and Kate Spade have long been the affordable luxury brands of choice for the aspirational shopper,,
7073," From Coachâ€™s embossed logo and leather handbags to Kate Spadeâ€™s kitschy, colorful accessories, their products lured buyers who wanted a taste of fashion without the sharpest edges â€” or the highest cost",,
7073,"But in recent years, those customers have gravitated to brands at more extreme ends of the style spectrum, toggling between e-commerce giants like Amazon, fast-fashion brands like H&M and Zara, and luxury houses like Gucci",,
7073,"Now, Coach has decided that its best path to growth is spending $2",,
7073,"4 billion for Kate Spade, hoping that expanding its portfolio of brands will help carve new territory in the crowded market",,
7073,"Its acquisition of Kate Spade, announced on Monday, confirms months of speculation on Wall Street, and is the latest in a series of purchases by the company, which aims to build a luxury group in the vein of European groups like LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering, with two major differences: an identifiably American aesthetic and price",,
7073,"Coachâ€™s handbags sell for $285 to $3,000, while Kate Spadeâ€™s retail for $100 to $500",,
7073," (Louis Vuittonâ€™s are priced from $970 to $15,800",,
7073,") The two companies also offer a combination of menâ€™s wear, ready-to-wear fashion, accessories, fragrances and homeware",,
7073,"â€œThe acquisition of Kate Spade is an important step in Coachâ€™s evolution as a customer-focused, multibrand organization,â€ù Victor Luis, chief executive of Coach, said in a statement on Monday",,
7073,"â€œWe believe Coachâ€™s extensive experience in opening and operating specialty retail stores globally, and brand building in international markets, can unlock Kate Spadeâ€™s largely untapped global growth potential,â€ù he added",,
7073,"Coach, which offered $18",,
7073,"50 a share in cash for Kate Spade, a premium of 9 percent on the closing price on Friday, said it expected to generate about $50 million in savings from the deal within three years",,
7073,"The company grew out of a wallet manufacturer in 1961 to produce handbags used by all manner of women, from full-time mothers to professional women",,
7073,"But it has fallen on harder times in recent years, struggling against heightened competition, its own discounting of products and a bloated store network",,
7073,Those difficulties mirror the challenges facing the retail sector in North America and beyond,,
7073,"While outlet stores have become more popular in recent years â€” Coach operates several hundred â€” department stores cannot attract the crowds they once did, and traffic to malls has slowed as people hunt for bargains online",,
7073,"Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, too, face the pressure of the migration to e-commerce, where once-mighty chains are struggling to catch up to Amazon and a crop of nimble digital upstarts",,
7073,"That has put more pressure on retailers, especially department stores, to slash prices and, therefore, squeeze profits",,
7073," Giants like Macyâ€™s, JC Penney and Neiman Marcus have faced particularly challenging times",,
7073,"But that race to the bottom has also affected some of the brands those department stores carry, from mass-market retailers like Gap, J Crew and Urban Outfitters to high-end names like Ralph Lauren",,
7073," Even Michael Kors, Coachâ€™s archrival and once a star in the sector, has been forced to retrench after a period of overexpansion",,
7073,"With its ubiquitous presence in shopping malls and department stores across the country, Coach has not been spared",,
7073,"This month, the company, which pioneered the sale of luxury handbags at relatively affordable prices, announced that department store revenue had fallen 40 percent in the most recent quarter, a sign of how heavy discounts, falling foot traffic and other troubles have seeped into the brand",,
7073,"â€œCoach stuff was just so ubiquitous, and the brand had become a bit devalued, and no one wanted to pay full price for it,â€ù said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with GlobalData Retail, a research firm",,
7073,"The constant discounting had diluted the brandâ€™s luxury appeal, and the company, under the direction of Mr",,
7073," Luis, looked for ways to cut back on the discounts â€” including closing a significant number of its locations within department stores, known as â€œshop-in-shops",,
7073,"â€ùâ€œIf you want to be a premium brand, you canâ€™t really be too strongly associated with some of the mainstream department stores like Macyâ€™s,â€ù Mr",,
7073, Saunders said,,
7073,"Affordable luxury, too, is a competitive sector",,
7073, Weaker brands cannot afford to discount too heavily and risk eroding their cache with customers even further,,
7073,"â€œIn many ways the market is ripe for consolidation, which is partly what the Coach and Kate Spade merger reflects,â€ù Mr",,
7073, Saunders said,,
7073, â€œItâ€™s about bringing together complementary brands,,
7073,â€ùKate Spade has also relied on heavy promotions,,
7073," But the company has been busy remaking itself into a lifestyle brand, one that could benefit from Coachâ€™s broad distribution channels",,
7073," As of July, Coach operated 228 retail locations and 204 outlets, along with 552 Coach-operated shop-in-shops, according to the companyâ€™s most recent annual report",,
7073,The Kate Spade acquisition is the latest step in an ambitious turnaround plan that Mr,,
7073, Luis has been leading,,
7073,"In 2014, he hired a new creative director, Stuart Vevers, who transformed the brand into a celebration of cool â€” a Route 66-inspired strain of Americana intended to appeal to millennials",,
7073, (A coming handbag collaboration with the pop star and actress Selena Gomez also will not hurt,,
7073,)Mr,,
7073," Luis also closed or renovated underperforming stores, re-examined Coachâ€™s pricing strategy and began a crusade to persuade customers to once again pay full price for its wares",,
7073,But crucial to his strategy was the ambition to build a multibrand luxury conglomerate,,
7073,Coach bought the American footwear brand Stuart Weitzman in 2015,,
7073," Analysts have speculated about whether Coach would buy Burberry, Britainâ€™s biggest luxury brand by sales",,
7073," And just this month, Coach was tipped as the favorite to buy Jimmy Choo, the British accessories label, when it was put up for sale just three years after being listed on the London stock market",,
7073,"Now Coach has Kate Spade, a company that has undergone its own transformations",,
7073,"Co-founded by a former fashion journalist in 1993, the brand was sold in 2006",,
7073," The next year, Kate Spadeâ€™s eponymous founder left the company",,
7073," In 2014, the firm that controlled the brand sold several other brands before renaming itself Kate Spade & Company",,
7073,The deal for Kate Spade was announced after analysts at HSBC wrote in a note to clients last week that Coach would be well suited to make acquisitions,,
7073,"â€œWhile M&A, is not often seen positively by equity markets in luxury, we believe that for Coach it is different,â€ù the analysts wrote",,
7073," Coach would benefit from making deals, they said, because it would reduce dependency on just one brand and lower the companyâ€™s reliance on its own-brand stores",,
7073,"Better-than-expected earnings for its third quarter, which ended April 1, suggest that Coachâ€™s strategy is paying off",,
7073,This is not the first time Coach has tried to expand its profile and balance sheet via separate brands,,
7073,"In 2009, after considering other acquisitions, Coach decided to create a brand from scratch and formed Reed Krakoff, a high-luxury brand with a minimalist architectural aesthetic founded by, and named for, Coachâ€™s executive creative director at the time",,
7073,"Though it received critical praise, the venture proved more costly than Coach had anticipated, and in 2013, it sold the company to a group of investors and Mr",,
7073," Krakoff, who left Coach to concentrate on his own brand",,
7073," But they struggled with the long profitability horizon of luxury goods, and in 2015, Reed Krakoff suspended trading",,
7073,"The moral of that story, at least for Mr",,
7073," Luis, seems to be to focus on the accessible luxury market",,

7075, What happens in Mobile doesnâ€™t resemble manufacturing so much as the assembly of a particularly large and tremendously complicated piece of Ikea furniture,,
7075," Here, the American workers attach the pieces of the airplane using tools and connectors, many of which are also imported from Europe",,
7075," Many of the supervisors come from the continent, too; the Mobile factory manager was raised about 10 miles from the wing plant in Wales",,
7075, And the company says that it saves no money by building planes in Mobile,,
7075,But Airbus has contorted its supply chain to end at an old military base in southern Alabama precisely because it can now build airplanes anywhere,,
7075," In this it resembles many of the worldâ€™s largest manufacturers, which now tend to be global operations that pull together components from hundreds of factories in dozens of countries to create products sold around the world",,
7075," And many of those companies, including Airbus, see advantages in completing the process in the markets where those products are sold",,
7075," It was politics, as much if not more than economics, that brought Airbus to Mobile",,
7075,Airbus executives realized years ago that the company could benefit from capturing a larger share of Americaâ€™s immense military budget,,
7075," And so it embarked on a strategy of investing in the South, a part of the United States that, historically, hosted only the military half of the military-industrial complex",,
7075," In 2004 the company opened a helicopter factory in Columbus, Miss",,
7075," In 2005, it won a Coast Guard contract to supply 36 maritime patrol aircraft; the planes were built in Spain, but Airbus opened a maintenance and repair facility in Mobile",,
7075," Then, in 2008, Airbus and Northrop Grumman were awarded one of the largest defense contracts in history: a $35 billion deal to build 179 refueling tankers for the Air Force, which Airbus promised to assemble in Mobile",,
7075,This small Alabama city had been trying to land an airplane factory for more than 30 years,,
7075," In 1993, officials thought they had a deal with McDonnell Douglas to build airplanes at Brookley Field",,
7075," Five years later, in 1998, a deal with an Indonesian airplane manufacturer seemed so sure that the city renamed a street Gatotkoco Drive after a mythical Indonesian warrior",,
7075," Five years after that, Mobile made the shortlist for a Boeing factory",,
7075," Each time, the city was left at the altar",,
7075, Airbusâ€™s Air Force contract seemed to suggest Mobileâ€™s search was over,,
7075, Not quite: Boeing snatched away the deal by persuading the government to reopen the bidding under a new set of rules,,
7075," Airbus concluded that its American roots needed to be deeper still, and it announced in 2012 that it would begin assembling passenger airplanes in Mobile",,
7075,Similar courtship rituals have brought a bevy of other manufacturers to Alabama in recent decades,,
7075," Next door to the Airbus factory is an airplane repair center, owned by the government of Singapore, that employs 1,300",,
7075," Across the harbor is an Australian shipbuilder that employs more than 4,000",,
7075, About 35 miles upriver is a giant steel plant jointly owned by companies based in Luxembourg and Japan,,
7075, And through Mobile harbor moves a steady flow of containers packed with auto parts for a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance; a Honda factory in Lincoln; and a new Hyundai factory in Montgomery,,
7075," Together, those three foreign automakers employ another 11,000 Alabama residents",,
7075,Alabama has paid handsomely for its factories,,
7075," The stateâ€™s industrial revolution began in 1993 when a new governor, Jim Folsom, outbid other states for the Mercedes-Benz plant",,
7075," (To land the deal, Folsom also agreed to remove a Confederate battle flag from the state capitol",,
7075,") Airbus, the most recent arrival, got $158",,
7075,"5 million in state and local benefits, including a school at Brookley where the state trains potential Airbus employees at public expense",,
7075," Of the 915 workers to be enrolled in the program, Airbus has hired 231",,
7075,"Many of the new employees had experience working on airplanes, either in the military or in the private sector",,
7075," But they still underwent long months of training, often including stints at other Airbus factories",,
7075, Megan Large was working behind the check-in counter at the Mobile Regional Airport when she landed a job at Airbus,,
7075," She spent a month in Hamburg and another month at the Airbus factory in Tianjin, China, before starting a job on the team that unpacks parts and moves planes around the factory floor",,
7075,"It helps that in Alabama, labor is cheap",,
7075, Airbus set a goal that building planes in the United States would not cost a penny more than building in Europe,,
7075," It is expensive to ship parts from Hamburg, but because the Mobile workers are not unionized, Airbus can hire fewer of them and pay them lower wages",,
7075," According to The Seattle Times, the starting rate at the Airbus plant, about $16",,
7075,"50 per hour, is comparable to the starting wages at Boeingâ€™s passenger-plane plant in Renton, Wash",,
7075," But the Airbus pay scale tops out at $23 an hour, while experienced Boeing workers can earn $45",,
7075,"That could change in years to come, but for now, organized labor has yet to gain a foothold",,
7075," The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents Boeingâ€™s workers in Renton, still rents a billboard outside the Airbus plant, but thatâ€™s about it",,
7075, The decline of American manufacturing has left a large pool of experienced workers who are eager to find new jobs and are more grateful than their European counterparts,,
7075," â€œIt baffles our European colleagues to see employees so proud of what theyâ€™re doing â€” and so excited,â€ù said Allan McArtor, chairman of Airbus Americas",,
7075,"Almost a third of American factory workers now hold four-year college degrees, a trend that reflects the increasingly cerebral nature of the work",,
7075," At the Airbus factory, few end the day with dirty hands or tired muscles",,
7075," Even the physical work requires care more than force; itâ€™s in the fingers, not the shoulders",,
7075, The final assembly-line hangar at the heart of the Airbus campus in Mobile is flooded with light and eerily quiet,,
7075," When I visited in March, I could hear a worker whistling all the way from the other side of the vast hall",,
7075,Airbus has no doubt that the Mobile plant has earned the company some allies in Congress,,
7075," â€œItâ€™s been night and day how weâ€™re received on Capitol Hill,â€ù McArtor said",,
7075, â€œThe attitude started changing immediately,,
7075,â€ù Airbus executives also hope U,,
7075,S,,
7075,#NAME?,,
7075," The Airbus 320 and its variants have outsold the Boeing 737 in nine of the last 10 years, but Airbus still lags behind Boeing in the American market",,
7075," A business consultant told Airbus executives that foreign automakersâ€™ sales had increased after they started building factories here, although no one was exactly sure why",,
7075," (Americans like to say that they prefer to buy products made in the United States as opposed to foreign-made goods, but there is little evidence that this stated preference actually influences their behavior",,
7075,") Moreover, it does not follow that airline executives would betray a similar bias",,
7075," But as McArtor notes, â€œIt doesnâ€™t have to move that market needle very much to have totally paid for the entire investment in Mobile",,
7075,"â€ùAlabama, for its part, hopes the Airbus factory is the start of something bigger",,
7075," In China, where Airbus began production about a half-decade ahead of the United States, a factory now makes the wings, too",,
7075," If production in Mobile continues to grow, it could become more efficient to bring more of the process to the United States",,
7075," About 20 Airbus suppliers have opened offices in Mobile; among them, the great success story is MAAS Aviation, an Irish company that paints each new Airbus plane and has expanded to paint for other aviation clients",,
7075," The company, which now has 55 employees in Alabama, focuses on hiring people from the Mobile area who have never painted airplanes before",,
7075, The reason: it wants workers with local roots who will be less likely to take their skills to another city,,
7075, And it wants them not to have been trained by American companies,,
7075," â€œAmerican workers expect things to go wrong and then they fix it,â€ù said Freddie Guinness, 25, who moved to Mobile from Ireland to manage the new facility",,
7075, â€œWe want it to go right the first time,,
7075,â€ù,,
7076,Dan Albertâ€™s farm is far from traditional,,
7076," There are no picturesque, rolling fields, no tractors tilling soil; there is no white farmhouse or red barn",,
7076," For that matter, there is no soil, or sunlight",,
7076,"The farm, Farmbox Greens, is inside a two-car garage behind Mr",,
7076, Albertâ€™s Seattle home,,
7076, It consists of 600 square feet of microgreens grown in vertically stacked trays beneath LED lights,,
7076,"The ability to grow in such a small space is the result of hydroponics, a system in which a plantâ€™s roots sit in nutrient-rich water instead of soil",,
7076,"Microgreens â€” the first, tiny greens on plants like arugula, radishes and bok choy â€” can go from seed to harvest in less than two weeks",,
7076, That enables Farmbox Greens to compete on price against produce delivered from far away,,
7076,"â€œWe are fresher and our greens last 20 to 30 percent longer than those grown outside the area,â€ù said Mr",,
7076," Albert, who co-owns the farm with his wife, Lindsay Sidlauskas",,
7076,"It has revenue of under $500,000, but was profitable enough in 2014 that Mr",,
7076, Albert quit his day job as a landscape architect to farm full time,,
7076," He now has three employees and sells his greens to about 50 restaurants in the Seattle area, a local grocery chain and four weekly farmersâ€™ markets",,
7076,"Consumer demand for locally grown food and the decreasing price and improved efficiency of LED lighting are driving the creation of more so-called vertical farm start-ups, said Chris Higgins, editor of Urban Ag News, which follows this segment of farming",,
7076,"Energy costs are still a significant barrier to success, making few vertical farms in the United States profitable",,
7076, Those that are tend to be smaller ones,,
7076,"They include City-Hydro, a farm built in a spare bedroom on the second floor of Larry and Zhanna Hountzâ€™s three-story rowhouse in Baltimore",,
7076, Mr,,
7076, Hountz came to urban farming out of necessity,,
7076," After a serious car accident, he was unable to leave his house for two years and had trouble concentrating",,
7076, He couldnâ€™t go back to his previous job as a digital security consultant,,
7076,â€œZhanna had gone to the grocery store and bought some heirloom tomatoes,,
7076," They were about $7 a pound,â€ù he said",,
7076," â€œI thought, â€˜I could grow those",,
7076,â€™â€ùHe converted a 10-foot-by-15-foot bedroom in their house into a vertical farm,,
7076, He raises 80 different varieties of microgreens that are sold to about a dozen local restaurants,,
7076,Mr,,
7076," Hountz said the farm generated about $120,000 in income, and he did not plan to expand",,
7076," â€œWe want to keep it a mom-and-pop operation,â€ù he said",,
7076,"Vertical farming uses no chemical pesticides and far less water and fertilizer than traditional farms, but energy costs can be high",,
7076," Even the best LED lights have only a 50 percent efficiency rate, said Bruce Bugbee, a professor of crop physiology at Utah State University who studies controlled environment agriculture",,
7076," That means half the electricity is converted to heat, not light",,
7076,"â€œTransportation costs account for about 4 percent of the energy in the food system,â€ù Professor Bugbee said",,
7076, â€œThe energy for electric lights is much greater than that,,
7076,"â€ùThe upshot is that indoor farming can produce as much as 20 times the amount of food per unit area as conventional outdoor farming, said Gene Giacomelli, the director of the Controlled Environment Agriculture Center and a professor in agricultural and biosystems engineering at the University of Arizona in Tucson",,
7076," As these farms scale up, however, they will need more electricity, not just for lighting but to run equipment like pumps and fans, Mr",,
7076, Giacomelli said,,
7076,"Green Spirit Farms in New Buffalo, Mich",,
7076,", is one operation that has found a way to be profitable on a slightly bigger scale",,
7076," The farm produces leafy greens like lettuce and kale in half of a 42,000-square-foot former plastics factory",,
7076,"Greens are grown hydroponically, in columns of stackable trays six levels high under â€œfrequency-specificâ€ù induction lights",,
7076," The light frequency used dictates what nutrient mix the plant gets, said Milan Kluko, Green Spiritâ€™s co-founder and chief executive",,
7076,"Green Spirit runs its system mostly on off-peak energy, from 7:01 p",,
7076,m,,
7076, to 6:59 a,,
7076,m,,
7076,", when rates are 30 percent lower",,
7076," The frequency-specific LED lights allowed the company to cut energy use 45 percent in the last six months, while crop yields have increased by about 40 percent",,
7076,"â€œThatâ€™s been a huge breakthrough for us,â€ù Mr",,
7076, Kluko said,,
7076," The farmâ€™s electric bill is about $7,000 a month now, and will most likely drop to $5,000 a month by yearâ€™s end, he said",,
7076,"The farm employs 11 people and produces about 5,000 pounds of mixed greens a month (7,000 pounds a month in the summer), selling to restaurants and retailers within a 100-mile radius",,
7076, It has raised $1,,
7076,5 million from investors and its annual sales are more than $1 million,,
7076,"Such successes are prompting other vertical farming operations to grow, and grow big",,
7076,Investment in food and agriculture technology start-ups was $4,,
7076,"6 billion in 2015, nearly double what it was in 2014, according to AgFunder, an online investment platform for the agricultural technology industry",,
7076, And local foods generated $11,,
7076,"7 billion in sales in 2014, which is predicted to increase to $20",,
7076,"2 billion by 2019, according to the consumer market research firm Packaged Facts",,
7076,"Edenworks, in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, uses an aquaponic system, which allows both plants and fish to be farmed at the same time, creating a self-regulating indoor ecosystem",,
7076, Tilapia are grown in tanks and their wastewater is pumped through a bioreactor where composting bacteria turn waste into fertilizer,,
7076, Plants use the fertilized water to grow and then the water is returned â€” minus the fertilizer â€” to the fish tanks,,
7076,"When the cost of LED lighting decreased, the company changed the greenhouse into a vertical, indoor stacked system, using shade cloth to block light and mimic a warehouse environment, said Jason Green, a co-founder and chief executive",,
7076,"Edenworks, which is not profitable, has received $1",,
7076,"5 million in funding and intends to build a 10,000 square-foot vertical farm in a vacant Brooklyn warehouse, which is expected to open before yearâ€™s end",,
7076, Mr,,
7076," Green said it should produce 130,000 pounds of leafy greens and 50,000 pounds of fish annually",,
7076,Yet profitability can be elusive for aquaponic farming,,
7076," According to a 2015 Department of Agriculture study on the economics of aquaponics, raising fish indoors is two to three times as expensive as raising fish in open ponds",,
7076,"Such setups are also labor-intensive, with multiple systems requiring constant monitoring, in addition to harvesting and packing",,
7076, A peer-reviewed survey of commercial aquaponics operations conducted in 2013 found that fewer than one-third of farms were profitable in the previous year,,
7076,"Still, Mr",,
7076, Green and his competitors are optimistic about the future of vertical farming,,
7076," David Rosenberg, the co-founder and chief executive of AeroFarms in Newark, said although his business was not profitable, he believed that would change when it got larger",,
7076," â€œYou really need economies of scale for this to work, to address a host of complexities,â€ù he said",,
7076,AeroFarms plans to build large vertical farms worldwide and has raised more than $70 million to fulfill its ambitions,,
7076," The company grows leafy greens aeroponically â€” by misting the roots with a cocktail of water, nutrients and oxygen",,
7076, Mr,,
7076, Rosenberg said his farm was 75 times as productive per square foot as a commercial field farm,,
7076,"The company is building its next farm and global headquarters in a 70,000-square-foot former steel mill in Newark",,
7076," It will be the largest indoor farm in the world, Mr",,
7076, Rosenberg said,,
7077,"Activist investors â€” money managers who seek to shake up a companyâ€™s strategy in search of huge paydays â€” have been growing in size and power in the United States, bending the knees of even the biggest corporate titans",,
7077,"Now, these investors are taking their fights overseas with bigger and bolder bets",,
7077,The latest to step onto the global stage is Daniel S,,
7077," Loeb, who in his first major European campaign is looking to rattle the Swiss food giant NestlÃ©",,
7077,By taking a $3,,
7077,"5 billion stake, including options â€” his biggest wager to date â€” Mr",,
7077, Loebâ€™s $17,,
7077,"5 billion hedge fund Third Point is betting that NestlÃ© can rev up its growth if it listens to Third Pointâ€™s proposals, which include selling off NestlÃ©â€™s stake in Lâ€™OrÃ©al",,
7077, Investors appeared to applaud Mr,,
7077," Loebâ€™s gambit, sending shares of NestlÃ© up 4",,
7077,3 percent in trading in Zurich on Monday,,
7077,Other European giants have entered activistsâ€™ cross hairs,,
7077," This year, Elliott Management, the $33 billion firm run by Paul E",,
7077," Singer, took on both the Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel and BHP Billiton, a British-Australian mining firm",,
7077,"With swelling coffers â€” activists now manage $121 billion on behalf of private investors, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds â€” and a growing number of competitors in the United States, some activists are finding more opportunities abroad than at home",,
7077,â€œThe U,,
7077,S,,
7077," market has lots of activists in it looking for ideas and has been picked over,â€ù said Greg Taxin, managing director of the activist advisory firm Spotlight Advisors and a founder of Glass, Lewis & Company",,
7077," â€œIf youâ€™re Paul Singer and managing $33 billion, you have to look into other markets, and you have to be sophisticated",,
7077,â€ùThe biggest American funds are no strangers to venturing abroad in their activist campaigns,,
7077," Elliott has been willing to take on Samsung, the biggest conglomerate in Asia, and Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong",,
7077, It even challenged the government of Argentina in a decade-long legal battle over that nationâ€™s debt default,,
7077,Mr,,
7077, Loeb has urged changes at Sony and other Japanese companies,,
7077, And Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners pushed for changes at the yogurt-and-Evian producer Danone five years ago,,
7077,"At a hedge fund conference in Las Vegas in May, managers talked about how Europe had transformed from a region of political uncertainty to one with stability",,
7077," And with the conclusion of many market-moving events, like Britainâ€™s decision to leave the European Union and Franceâ€™s presidential election, Europe has become a region with more certainty than the United States, where political turmoil swirls around the Trump White House",,
7077,"At the same time, many European countries lack the sort of obstacles that American companies can throw at activists, said David Hunker, the head of shareholder activism defense at JPMorgan Chase",,
7077,"â€œIn general, Europe as a whole is easier from an activist perspective,â€ù he said",,
7077, â€œThe types of structural protections that you have in the U,,

7077,"â€ùIndeed, Switzerlandâ€™s corporate law could provide some help to Mr",,
7077, Loeb,,
7077,"In Switzerland, shareholders elect each member of the board individually, meaning that if Mr",,
7077," Loeb chose to nominate a new board member and that candidate received a majority of the vote, that candidate would be added to the board without a contest",,
7077,"â€œIt makes it easier for an activist to get someone on the board,â€ù Mr",,
7077, Taxin said,,
7077,"On Monday, a representative for NestlÃ© said in a statement: â€œAs always, we keep an open dialogue with all of our shareholders, and we remain committed to executing our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value",,
7077," Beyond that, we have no specific comment",,
7077,â€ùMr,,
7077, Loeb declined to comment for this article,,
7077,"The ambitious corporate campaigns abroad speak to the maturation of the hedge fund industry, as well as to the growth of American-style activism",,

7077, Peltz and William A,,
7077, Ackman have at times been welcomed by these same shareholders and seen as a positive force for change in a recalcitrant company,,
7077,"These same institutional shareholders have in turn begun to see activism as a lucrative investment, pouring billions into activist hedge funds",,
7077,"With more money in the sector, and more activists searching for companies to wage campaigns against, the landscape in the United States has become crowded",,
7077,When Mr,,

7077,"Despite pressure from Elliott, Akzo Nobel rebuffed a takeover attempt by its American rival PPG Industries",,
7077, Mr,,

7077, Such firms have often indicated a willingness to back activists to bolster a companyâ€™s stock price,,
7077,"Still, American hedge funds like Elliott and Third Point have learned to be mindful of local culture and tend to conduct less overtly hostile campaigns",,
7077,Mr,,
7077, Loeb has forged a reputation for writing stinging criticisms in so-called poison-pen letters to corporate chieftains,,
7077," So far, however, Mr",,

7078,WASHINGTON â€” Donald J,,
7078, Trumpâ€™s blistering critique of American trade policy boils down to a simple equation: Foreigners are â€œkilling us on tradeâ€ù because Americans spend much more on imports than the rest of the world spends on American exports,,
7078," Chinaâ€™s unbalanced trade with the United States, he said Tuesday night, is â€œthe greatest theft in the history of the world",,
7078,"â€ùAdd a few â€œwhereinsâ€ù and â€œwhencesâ€ù and that sentiment would conform nicely to the worldview of the first Queen Elizabeth of 16th-century England, to the 17th-century court of Louis XIV, or to Prussiaâ€™s Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in the 19th century",,
7078," The great powers of bygone centuries subscribed to the economic theory of mercantilism, â€œWherein we must ever observe this rule: to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value,â€ù as its apostle, the East India Company director Thomas Mun, wrote in the 1600s",,
7078,Now Mr,,
7078, Trump is bringing mercantilism back,,
7078," The New York billionaire is challenging the last 200 years of economic orthodoxy that trade among nations is good, and that more is better",,
7078,"He is well on his way to becoming the first Republican nominee in nearly a century who has called for higher tariffs, or import taxes, as a broad defense against low-cost imports",,
7078," And there is a good chance he would face a Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who has expressed fewer reservations about trade, inverting a longstanding political dynamic",,
7078,"Among Republican standard-bearers, â€œThereâ€™s nobody since Hoover who talked this way about trade,â€ù said I",,

7078,Mr,,
7078, Trumpâ€™s mercantilism is among his oldest and steadiest public positions,,

7078," The trade deficit with China, which reached $366 billion last year, makes America the biggest loser",,
7078," â€œOur trade deficit with China is like having a business that continues to lose money every single year,â€ù Mr",,

7078," Hereâ€™s the story, folks: Every single air-conditioning unit that you build and send across our border â€” youâ€™re going to pay a 35 percent tax on that unit",,
7078,"â€™ â€ùIn January, Mr",,
7078, Trump proposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports during a meeting with the New York Times editorial board,,
7078," â€œI would tax China on products coming in,â€ù he said",,
7078," â€œI would do a tariff, yes",,
7078,â€ùEconomists have long struggled against the popular view that exports are a measure of economic vitality while imports are evidence of regrettable dependence,,
7078,They argue that the opposite is true,,
7078,"â€œEconomists have spoken with almost one voice for some 200 years,â€ù the economist Milton Friedman said in a 1978 speech",,
7078, â€œThe gain from foreign trade is what we import,,
7078, What we export is the cost of getting those imports,,
7078," And the proper objective for a nation, as Adam Smith put it, is to arrange things so we get as large a volume of imports as possible for as small a volume of exports as possible",,
7078,â€ùBut critiques like Mr,,
7078, Trumpâ€™s resonate in part because economists have oversold their case,,
7078," Trade has a downside, and while the benefits of trade are broadly distributed, the costs are often concentrated",,
7078,"Everyone can buy a cheaper air-conditioner when Carrier debarks for a lower-cost country, but a few hundred people will lose their livelihoods",,
7078,"Pietra Rivoli, a finance professor at Georgetown University who explored the effect of increased globalization in her 2005 book, â€œThe Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy,â€ù said Mr",,
7078, Trump might be finding a receptive audience in part because the United States had provided relatively little help to workers harmed by trade,,
7078,â€œYou have much more negative sentiment about trade in the U,,
7078,S,,
7078," than you do in pretty much any other wealthy country, and theyâ€™ve lost their T-shirt jobs, too,â€ù Ms",,
7078, Rivoli said,,
7078," â€œWhatâ€™s going on there is that in those countries, which are even more exposed to trade than we are, those countries have a bigger safety net",,
7078,â€ùMr,,
7078," Trump has also accused other nations, notably Japan and China, of cheating by suppressing the value of their currencies to make their exports cheaper",,
7078,"â€œI am all for free trade, but itâ€™s got to be fair,â€ù Mr",,
7078, Trump has said repeatedly,,
7078,Economists persuaded governments to abandon mercantilism by demonstrating that trade barriers imposed higher prices on the masses while narrowly benefiting those sheltered from competition,,
7078,"The United States largely dismantled its broad tariffs in the mid-20th century, opening the modern era of globalization",,
7078," But some tariffs remain, providing a reminder of the costs and benefits",,
7078," Annual imports of Chinese tires increased to 46 million in 2008 from 15 million in 2004, and American tire makers shed several thousand jobs",,
7078,"So in 2009, the Obama administration, at the urging of workersâ€™ unions, imposed a Trump-like tariff beginning at 35 percent and expiring after three years",,
7078,"â€œOver a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires,â€ù President Obama said in his 2012 State of the Union address",,
7078,"The measure, however, also increased the amount that Americans spent on tires by about $1",,
7078,"1 billion, according to calculations by Gary Clyde Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics",,
7078," That money, had it been spent on other things, would have supported jobs in other parts of the economy",,
7078,"China, moreover, retaliated by slapping a punitive tariff on American chicken parts â€” China is a particularly lucrative market for chicken feet â€” which cost American poultry exporters about $1 billion in lost sales over the same period",,
7078,"Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, said Mr",,
7078, Trump was raising legitimate concerns,,
7078," Other nations do impose disproportionate restrictions on American goods, he said",,
7078," The problem, Mr",,
7078," Prasad said, is the proposed solution",,
7078,"â€œIt might be that the threat of tariffs or other trade sanctions could cause American trading partners to open up their markets or drop their barriers to trade,â€ù Mr",,
7078, Prasad said,,
7078," â€œPerhaps as a bargaining chip, itâ€™s not necessarily so bad",,
7078," But there is a risk that rather than having that positive effect, it leads to retaliation on both sides",,

7080,"A MODERN HOME WITH OCEAN VIEWS IN PLAYA HERMOSA$975,000This contemporary four-bedroom four-bath house sits on a hillside overlooking Playa Hermosa, a small cluster of homes and businesses in the Guanacaste province on the northwest coast of Costa Rica",,
7080," The house is in Monte Paraiso, a gated development with 37 lots, where 27 homes have been built",,
7080," Most of the homes sell for $1 million to $2 million, according to local agents",,
7080, (Home prices in Costa Rica are typically listed in American dollars,,
7080,")This house was constructed inÂ 2006 by Tom Terry, who has built many homes in the area, said Michael Simons, co-owner of Re/Max Prestige Ocean Properties, the listing agent for the house",,
7080," The two-story design features stark white walls, floor-to-ceiling windows and travertine floors, covering 4,000 square feet of living area",,
7080," Most rooms have access to wide terraces, offering panoramic views of the Hermosa Bay and, in the distance, Peninsula Papagayo, a lush 1,400-acre master-planned luxury development anchored by a Four Seasons resort",,
7080,"The main entrance to the home is on the U-shaped second floor, which has two master bedroom suites on either side of a wide hallway",,
7080, The hall leads to tall windows and a terrace with ocean views,,
7080, Each master bedroom includes a bathroom and an entrance to a terrace; each master bath features a Jacuzzi tub,,
7080,"A staircase with metal railings leads down to the main living area, an open space that includes the living room and dining room",,
7080, (The furniture is included in the price,,
7080,") The kitchen features granite countertops, stainless-steel appliances, a pantry and the same large windows found elsewhere in the house",,
7080," The bottom level includes two more bedrooms with full baths, one with a bathtub and one with a shower",,
7080,The glass doors in the dining room open to a large wooden deck with an infinity pool featuring water jets with lighting,,
7080, Stairs off the deck lead to a yoga platform,,
7080," There is no garage, but there is a carport",,
7080," The current owners often rent the house for $3,000 to $6,000 a week, depending on the season, Mr",,
7080, Simons said,,
7080,"The house, which has been on the market for about 18 months, is only a few minutesâ€™ drive down the hill to Playa Hermosa, where there is a smattering of small hotels and restaurants and a wide sandy beach bookended by small mountains",,
7080," Larger markets and restaurants can be found in neighboring Playas del Coco, about a 10-minute drive, where a Hard Rock Cafe recently opened",,
7080," Guanacaste is a dry region, with only pockets of the deep jungle that characterizes the south of Costa Rica, but it is popular for fishing, scuba diving and golf",,
7080, The international airport in Liberia is about a 20-minute drive from Playa Hermosa,,
7080,"MARKET OVERVIEWThe real estate market in the Guanacaste region took a dramatic turn in 1995, when the Daniel Oduber QuirÃ_s International Airport opened in Liberia",,
7080," The new airport allowed international visitors to the Guanacaste coast to avoid the five-hour drive on narrow, winding roads from the crowded airport in the capital of San JosÃ©",,
7080,"The Liberia airport sparked a wave of construction and second-home sales in Playa Hermosa, with North Americans the biggest group of buyers",,
7080," Peninsula Papagayo was one of several luxury resort developments that opened in the area, and many more were planned",,
7080," But the market stalled in 2008, when the economy crashed in the United States, and several announced resort projects were halted",,
7080,"â€œWe just came to a stop,â€ù Mr",,
7080, Simons said,,
7080,"Prices didnâ€™t drop as far as in some second-home markets around the world, since most of the homes had been purchased for cash and the owners didnâ€™t need to sell, agents say",,
7080," But there were few transactions, with most of the activity focused on deals with steep discounts",,
7080,"In the last year the market has â€œcompletely changed,â€ù says Vladimir Spivak, an agent with Palm Real Estate in Guanacaste",,
7080," â€œThe last of the fire salesâ€ù is over and the number of homes for sale has shrunk, he says",,
7080, â€œThereâ€™s almost nothing left,,
7080,"â€ù At the same time, â€œthe rental market is very tight,â€ù he said",,
7080,"Most of the sales are less expensive homes, agents say",,
7080, Seventy-five percent of Mr,,
7080," Simonsâ€™s recent deals have been for those priced below $500,000",,
7080," â€œThe luxury market is still not that hot right now, but it is better than it has been,â€ù Mr",,
7080, Simons said,,
7080,"While home prices have stabilized in recent years, land prices remain far below peak levels, Mr",,
7080, Spivak says,,
7080," A half-acre plot that might have sold for $400,000 in 2008 now sells for closer to $150,000, he says",,
7080,"People found it â€œhard to build,â€ù because of the time required, construction costs and Costa Rican bureaucracy, Mr",,
7080, Spivak said,,
7080," It has been easier to buy a completed house, leaving a ready supply of unsold lots, he said",,
7080,Today activity has resumed in the construction market,,
7080," Two resorts opened in the area in the last two years, including a Hyatt-branded hotel on Peninsula Papagayo, and two more are scheduled to be completed within the next year, agents say",,
7080,"WHO BUYS IN COSTA RICAAmericans dominate the Playa Hermosa market, agents say",,
7080," While Canadians once made up about 30 percent of buyers, sales to that group have fallen off since the Canadian dollar started to decline in value in 2013, they say",,
7080,There has also been a shift in why people are buying,,
7080," Speculators and investors were once the most active buying group, but these days most people are purchasing a home for their personal use, agents say",,
7080," Some may rent their house to tourists in the short term, but their plan is to eventually use it",,
7080,"While retirees have always liked Playa Hermosaâ€™s sunny weather and wide beach, â€ùweâ€™re seeing a lot of younger people coming into the market now,â€ù Mr",,
7080, Simons said,,
7080, â€œSome are opening a business and moving to Costa Rica,,
7080,"â€ùBUYING BASICSWhile the system for buying property in Costa Rica is straightforward, international buyers will need patience, local experts say",,
7080," â€œIn Costa Rica, everything takes longer,â€ù said HernÃ¡n Cordero, a partner in Cordero & Cordero Abogados, a law firm with offices in Liberia",,
7080,"Typically, after a buyer signs an option to purchase a property, there is a 30-day period of due diligence",,
7080," Buyers place a refundable deposit, usually from 5 to 10 percent of the purchase price, in an escrow account",,
7080," â€œYou have to use a legal escrow service, registered and insured,â€ù Mr",,
7080," Spivak said, adding that buyers should never send deposit money directly to a lawyer or third party",,
7080,"A central national property registry tracks all property, including information on the owners, liens and other issues that might have an impact on the property",,
7080," â€œIt gives a lot of security, in terms of who the owner is,â€ù Mr",,
7080, Cordero said,,
7080,A licensed notary is the key person in any property transaction,,
7080," In Costa Rica, all notaries are attorneys; but not all attorneys are notaries",,
7080,"Prospective buyers â€œreally should get a good lawyer,â€ù Mr",,
7080, Spivak said,,
7080," â€œAlthough it is a pretty good system, you have to check things",,
7080,"â€ùIn addition to confirming the ownership of the property and checking for liens, buyers should make sure the property has all the correct permits for building on the land and for utility services, Mr",,
7080, Cordero said,,
7080," â€œYou canâ€™t take for granted the property has all the permits for services,â€ù he said",,
7080,"Itâ€™s also advisable to hire an inspector to make sure the property is not damaged and is compliant with local standards, agents say",,
7080,"â€œDonâ€™t take anything for granted,â€ù Mr",,

7080, Cordero said,,

7082,"There was no grand unveiling, no ceremony to show it off",,
7082," But when the Mets opened their 2017 season at Citi Field, a new placard was affixed to the overhang down the left-field line",,
7082, It proclaimed the Mets as winners of a 2016 National League wild card,,
7082,"As the Yankees prepared for their home opener on Monday, they had nothing comparable to display",,
7082," We live, for the moment, in that rare baseball weather pattern in which the skies are sunnier over Queens than over the Bronx",,
7082," The Metsâ€™ attendance is rising, and while the Yankees still outdraw them, their attendance is falling",,
7082,"As they market young players rather than marquee names, and as two teams â€” the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Detroit Tigers â€” outspend them on salaries, the Yankees are striving to retain their sense of identity",,
7082," This was the motivation behind General Manager Brian Cashmanâ€™s moves last summer, when he steered the franchise on a course he has sought for years",,
7082,Cashman wants the Yankees to stand out again,,
7082," Acting like so many competitors â€” scheming to beat long odds to grab a wild-card spot, and then trying to get lucky again in October â€” was not working",,
7082, It was not them,,
7082,"â€œWe donâ€™t stick up banners for being a wild-card team,â€ù Cashman said as he sat on the bench in the Yankeesâ€™ dugout late in spring training",,
7082, â€œWe never stuck up banners for American League champions,,
7082," Iâ€™m not saying youâ€™re not proud to get into the postseason, whether itâ€™s a wild card or division champion, but the ultimate thing is, you want to be remembered",,
7082, And to be remembered is to win championships,,
7082,"â€ùThe Yankees have won 27, the last four with Cashman as general manager",,
7082," His contract expires after this season, but no one in the organization expects him to leave or be fired",,
7082," Of the top baseball operations officials among the 30 major league teams, none has been with his club as long as Cashman has",,
7082,"Cashman, 49, started as an intern in the Yankeesâ€™ minor league and scouting department in 1986, a dozen years before George Steinbrenner named him general manager",,
7082," Cashmanâ€™s first three teams won the World Series, his fourth won a pennant, and his next three won at least 101 games",,
7082, The 2009 team won another championship,,
7082,"The Yankees have maintained winning records ever since, but have played in just one playoff game in the last four seasons, a wild-card loss to Houston in 2015",,
7082," Wild-card teams have won the World Series, of course, but to Cashman, true competitiveness had become an illusion",,
7082,"Late last July, he dealt Aroldis Chapman to the Chicago Cubs",,
7082," Then he dealt Andrew Miller to Cleveland, a watershed decision because Miller â€” perhaps the best reliever in baseball â€” was signed through 2018",,
7082," After that, the moves kept coming: Carlos Beltran to Texas, Ivan Nova to Pittsburgh, Alex Rodriguez to retirement, Brian McCann to Houston",,
7082,"Now Gary Sanchez, Greg Bird and Aaron Judge have spots in the lineup, and no retreads were imported to bump young starters from the rotation",,
7082," With the endorsement of Hal Steinbrenner, the managing general partner, this is Cashmanâ€™s vision in action, though neither could have predicted the grim health news last week: a biceps injury that sent Sanchez to the disabled list, a foot injury that slowed Bird and a potentially serious elbow injury to the top pitching prospect James Kaprielian",,
7082,"Even so, the Yankeesâ€™ farm system â€” fortified by the additions of Gleyber Torres, Clint Frazier, Justus Sheffield and Dillon Tate â€” now ranks second in overall talent, according to Baseball America",,
7082," There are no banners for that, either, but the Yankees finally seem committed to cultivating the kind of low-cost, high-impact talent base that will allow them to spend lavishly on free agents again",,
7082,"â€œThings had to be turned over, and it took some courage, especially in this town,â€ù said Randy Levine, the Yankeesâ€™ president",,
7082, â€œIt took some fortitude to go in a new direction,,
7082, Cash was really the architect,,
7082," He sold Hal on it, and hopefully it will work",,
7082,"â€ùHal Steinbrenner has known Cashman since 1991, when Steinbrenner worked for his fatherâ€™s team after college",,
7082," They have known each other so long, Steinbrenner said, that there is an underpinning of honesty in their relationship, and mutual respect",,
7082,"â€œAny time you survive in your job for an extended period, part of it has to be not only your ability, but your ability to communicate with your ownership,â€ù said Dave Dombrowski, the president of baseball operations for the Boston Red Sox",,
7082, â€œThat has to be an extremely important part of the equation,,
7082,"â€ùAs Detroitâ€™s general manager in 2015, Dombrowski traded Yoenis Cespedes to the Mets and David Price to Toronto",,
7082," Both players helped propel their teams deep into October, just as Miller and Chapman did last fall after Cashman traded them",,
7082,"The difference is that Cashman has stayed on with the Yankees, and Dombrowski was fired soon after his deals",,
7082," Dombrowski is a highly successful executive, but like most, he has guided multiple teams",,
7082, Cashman has always survived,,
7082,"When a team takes a new direction, it often does so with a new general manager; typically, if the incumbent had been doing well, there will be no need to change strategy",,
7082," But Steinbrenner has the opposite impulses of his father, and Cashmanâ€™s job status â€” like that of Manager Joe Girardi, whose contract also expires this season â€” never seems in jeopardy",,
7082,"â€œI try to be a pretty even-keeled thinker,â€ù Steinbrenner said",,
7082, â€œIâ€™m objective,,
7082, Thatâ€™s my nature,,
7082, Thatâ€™s the way I come to decisions,,
7082,â€ùSteinbrenner said he appreciated how Cashman balanced the analytics and scouting acumen needed to run a modern baseball operations department,,
7082," Surely, it seems, he also understands that the current state of the Yankees is a group effort",,
7082, Whatever the Yankees are now â€” for better or worse â€” is not all Cashmanâ€™s doing,,
7082,"Consider the summer of 2013, when an injury-ravaged roster tried futilely to claw into the playoff race",,
7082," The Yankeesâ€™ best player, second baseman Robinson Cano, was facing free agency",,
7082, Cashman told Steinbrenner what he wanted to do,,
7082,"â€œWe should trade Cano before heâ€™s a free agent, because he will not re-sign with us,â€ù Cashman said, repeating the recommendation he made at the time",,
7082, â€œTheyâ€™re looking at money we wonâ€™t be willing to commit,,
7082, Theyâ€™re looking for a 10-year deal,,
7082,"â€ùCano, who turned 31 just after that season, eventually got a 10-year, $240 million bonanza from the Seattle Mariners",,
7082," Though the Yankees gave a seven-year, $153 million deal that winter to Jacoby Ellsbury â€” who has declined sharply â€” Cashman said the team would benefit in the future from having resisted a 10-year commitment to Cano",,
7082,"How much could the Yankees have benefited by trading Cano instead of losing him as a free agent? Cashman never found out, because he was told not to put Cano on the market",,
7082," The 2013 Yankees failed in their push for the playoffs, finishing 85-77, six games out of a wild-card spot",,
7082,"â€œItâ€™s not easy for ownership,â€ù Cashman said",,
7082," â€œHal Steinbrenner is a pilot, and he uses pilot analogies all the time with me",,
7082," Since Iâ€™m director of baseball operations, I get to look at things at 5,000 feet",,
7082," Heâ€™s the owner, so he has to look at things at 30,000 feet",,
7082,"â€œHe has sponsorship commitments; heâ€™s got partners,â€ù Cashman continued",,
7082," â€œHeâ€™s got a season-ticket holder base, the TV network ratings, even though most of that is now owned by Fox",,
7082, Thereâ€™s a responsibility he feels and a whole bunch of other things he has to account for that I donâ€™t,,
7082,"â€œI can be a lot more practical because itâ€™s pure baseball â€” whatâ€™s the best baseball move? And Iâ€™m just like, â€˜The business is baseball, and if this is a good baseball decision, eventually it should be good for all other decisions",,
7082,â€™ But I donâ€™t own a club,,
7082," I donâ€™t have to make those types of decisions, and those responsibilities are much greater",,
7082,"â€ùAt various points in the past decade and a half, Cashman said, he resisted job offers from at least five other teams because of loyalty to George Steinbrenner, who died in 2010",,
7082," Cashman never planned to be a baseball executive, and Steinbrenner had made him one, even if he regretted it at times when Cashman made his debut in 1998",,
7082,"A few months into that season, said Gene Michael, who had assembled the guts of the Yankeesâ€™ roster, Steinbrenner was convinced he had made a mistake",,
7082," â€œStick,â€ù he told Michael, â€œyouâ€™re going to have to come back and do this job",,
7082,"â€ù Michael, an adviser, shrugged it off",,
7082," When Michael was general manager, Steinbrenner had said the same thing about him",,
7082,"â€œBrian can do it,â€ù Michael said he told Steinbrenner",,
7082, â€œJust give him time,,
7082,"â€ùOver time, the rules of team-building have changed",,
7082," Increased luxury-tax penalties have made it costlier â€” and more foolish â€” to sustain lush payrolls, year after year",,
7082," Spending on the draft and international markets has been heavily regulated, negating another edge the Yankees once had on their rivals",,
7082,"In Cashmanâ€™s first several seasons as general manager, baseball did not test for performance-enhancing drugs, making it easier for older players to stay productive well into their free-agent years",,
7082," Now, by the time they reach free agency, many are clearly past their primes, making it even more important to develop young talent",,
7082," And because they have compiled 24 winning seasons in a row, the Yankees have not picked higher than 16th in the draft since 1993",,
7082,"â€œItâ€™s not a complaint, but weâ€™re not ever allowed to drop down, lose 100 on purpose and be rewarded for the quote-unquote â€˜tankingâ€™ thatâ€™s been in play,â€ù Cashman said",,
7082, â€œThatâ€™s not a path weâ€™re allowed to do,,
7082,"â€ùTo be sure, some of the gameâ€™s best players are found in the top half of the first round: Kris Bryant, Clayton Kershaw, Manny Machado, Buster Posey and so on",,
7082," But while it is true that the Yankees never could have drafted those players, plenty of other stars have gone outside the top 30, like Mookie Betts, Josh Donaldson, Anthony Rizzo and Noah Syndergaard",,
7082," Besides Dellin Betances (drafted 254th over all in 2006), those kinds of success stories have largely eluded the Yankees",,
7082,"Then again, Bird (179th over all in 2011) and Judge (32nd over all in 2013) offer hope",,
7082, And the Yankees did use the pitchers Adam Warren and Shane Greene â€” both drafted well beyond the 100th overall pick â€” in trades for the middle-infield duo of Starlin Castro and Didi Gregorius,,
7082,"â€œYouâ€™ve got to string together as many quality decisions as you can over time â€” a five-, six-, seven-year period â€” to put yourself in a championship-caliber conversation,â€ù Cashman said",,
7082," â€œIf you make the wrong decisions, it can really pull you back",,
7082,"â€ùSometimes, though, past decisions are hard to classify",,
7082, The Yankees surely could not have won the 2009 World Series without Rodriguez and C,,
7082, C,,
7082, Sabathia,,
7082," But those players, whose contracts were both extended, are still on the payroll for a combined $46 million this season â€” Sabathia as a roughly league-average starter, and Rodriguez in an advisory role",,
7082,"When teams agree to lavish long-term contracts, they typically enjoy the present and say they will worry about the future later",,
7082," That future is now for the Yankees, but Cashman remembers when times were worse",,
7082, When you are working in New York â€” where an everyday problem can seem like a crisis â€” institutional memory helps,,
7082,"â€œLook at TV when Don Mattingly was hitting home runs and thereâ€™s nobody in the stands in right field â€” itâ€™s empty,â€ù Cashman said",,
7082," Then he cited a string of forgettable names (Chuck Cary, Dave LaPoint), regrettable trades (Rickey Henderson to get Luis Polonia, Greg Cadaret and Eric Plunk) and embarrassing moments, like the time Andy Hawkins threw a no-hitter and lost, 4-0",,
7082,"Cashman saw the empire crumble, saw George Steinbrenner serve a ban of nearly three years as the Yankees rebuilt and saw a dynasty grow from the wreckage",,
7082," He knows what an organizational reset, even a less drastic one, can do",,
7082,"â€œI had a front-row seat for all of that stuff,â€ù Cashman said",,
7082," â€œThat gives me at least a platform to have dialogue with ownership as well as combat the media narrative, which can be false or forgotten",,
7082, Iâ€™m like: â€˜Weâ€™ve done it,,
7082, I was there for it; I lived through it,,
7082," Yes, you can",,
7082,"â€™ As long as you honestly articulate with the fan base what youâ€™re doing and why youâ€™re doing it, then yes â€” itâ€™s been done, can be done and will be done again",,
7082,"â€ùA dynasty, Cashman acknowledged, is always an outlier, a rare confluence of so many factors, especially luck",,
7082," This is now the longest period in major league history without a repeat champion, a stretch that began in 2001, when the Arizona Diamondbacks ended the Yankeesâ€™ three-year reign",,
7082,Cashman does not wear his rings and has never lifted a World Series trophy,,
7082," In 2009, when the players and several executives gathered on a podium behind second base to celebrate the Yankeesâ€™ return to glory, he watched from the field with his daughter, just another face in a happy crowd",,
7082,"For those who know Cashman, it was no surprise",,
7082," Raised in the game under George Steinbrennerâ€™s glare, he has always known better than to revel in accomplishment",,
7082,"â€œWhat I really admired about Brian was the fact that it was never about him,â€ù said John Coppolella, the Atlanta Bravesâ€™ general manager, who worked for the Yankees from 2000 to 2006",,
7082, â€œHe just seemed to care a great deal about the Yankees and getting things right for them,,
7082,â€ùThings are not right at the moment,,
7082," For all the encouraging signs around the Yankees, this team still seems destined to not be remembered, at least by their standards",,
7082," At least a dozen teams, realistically, have a much better chance to win the next World Series",,
7082,But Cashman believes in the Yankeesâ€™ direction,,
7082," He is keenly aware of the winding road that got them here, and has plotted their path forward",,
7082,"â€œWeâ€™ve been brought down â€” some of it by decisions weâ€™ve made that havenâ€™t worked out, and some of it by market constraints,â€ù he said",,
7082," â€œNow weâ€™re going through that process of cleansing, and weâ€™re bringing ourselves back up",,
7082,â€ù,,
7083,"BEIJING â€” China's factory activity shrank more sharply than expected in October amid weak consumer demand and a tariff war with Washington, a survey by an industry group showed Thursday",,
7083,The monthly purchasing managers' index of the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing declined to 49,,
7083,3 from September's 49,,
7083,8 on a 100-point scale,,
7083, Numbers below 50 show activity contracting,,
7083,"Chinese growth has been hurt by weakening consumer demand as shoppers, jittery over the trade war and possible job losses, put off purchases of cars and other big-ticket goods",,
7083,Exporters have been hurt by President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese imports in a fight over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus bu the impact on the overall economy has been limited,,
7083,"The latest data suggest improved activity at the end of the previous quarter ""didn't mark the start of a sustained recovery,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report",,
7083,Growth in the world's second-largest economy sank to a new multi-decade low of 6% in the quarter ending in September,,
7083,Sales of Chinese goods to the U,,
7083,S,,
7083, market fell almost 11% from a year earlier in the first nine months of this year,,
7083, But global exports are off only 0,,
7083,1% in the same period due to stronger sales to developing markets,,
7084,The financial markets today are looking very much like they did a decade or so ago,,
7084, And that can mean only one scary thing: Trouble is imminent,,
7084,"Just as they did in much of 2007 and 2008, before the markets exploded in a crisis of epic proportions, investors in the debt market, which is even larger than the equity market, are feverishly chasing higher yields and are too eagerly buying up the risky securities that will deliver those yields without demanding the proper premium for the risks being taken",,
7084," A decade ago, the high-yield investment du jour pushed by Wall Street was mortgage-backed securities â€” home mortgages that had been packaged up and sold as â€œsafeâ€ù investments all over the world",,
7084," Nowadays bankers and traders are pushing another form of supposedly â€œsafeâ€ù investment, the â€œcollateralized loan obligation,â€ù or C",,
7084,L,,
7084,O,,
7084,C,,
7084,L,,
7084,O,,
7084,s are nothing more than a package of risky corporate loans made to companies with less than stellar credit,,
7084," The big Wall Street banks make these loans to their corporate clients and then seek to move them off their balance sheets as quickly as possible, in the same way that a decade ago they packaged up and offloaded risky mortgage securities",,
7084," Just as with mortgage-backed securities, to move the loans out the door the banks have been counting on the nearly insatiable demand for higher yields â€” the combination of the price paid for a bond and the interest received â€” from investors who figure the risky loans will make them more than they could get by, say, investing in safer Treasury bonds",,
7084, (A few percentage-pointâ€™s difference in the yield adds up to real money,,
7084,)This is not a tiny slice of the market,,
7084," Of the trillions of dollars of corporate loans outstanding in the United States, roughly $1",,
7084,"2 trillion of them are considered â€œleveraged loans,â€ù or loans to companies considered bigger credit risks",,
7084," Some of those companies will not be able to handle the high level of debt they have taken on, and when they reach the breaking point, corporate bankruptcies will again begin to rise",,
7084,"And those failures could be a serious concern, if smart people like Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, are to be believed",,
7084," In a speech before the Economic Club of New York in November, Mr",,
7084, Powell said he thought that investors in C,,
7084,L,,
7084,O,,
7084,"s would bear the brunt of an uptick in corporate bankruptcies, rather than the big Wall Street banks",,
7084," Those investors include Japanese banks as well as investors in hedge funds, mutual funds and pension funds (in other words, you and me)",,
7084,"Janet Yellen, Mr",,
7084," Powellâ€™s predecessor, aired the same concern in December, in a conversation with the Times columnist Paul Krugman",,
7084, Ms,,
7084," Yellen said she worried that corporate indebtedness was â€œquite highâ€ù: itâ€™s now more than $9 trillion, up from $4",,
7084,"9 trillion, in 2006, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association",,
7084," â€œI think a lot of the underwriting of that debt is weak,â€ù she said",,
7084," â€œI think investors hold it in packages like the subprime packages,â€ù which became so popular before the 2008 crisis",,
7084, â€œThe same thing has happened,,
7084, Itâ€™s called C,,
7084,L,,
7084,O,,
7084,"s, or collateralized loan obligations",,
7084,"â€ùRandal Quarles, who oversees Wall Street supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, also highlighted the looming systemic risk to the financial system, if and when C",,
7084,L,,
7084,O,,
7084,s start getting hit by defaults,,
7084," On the one hand, he told the Council on Foreign Relations in December, he takes comfort from the fact that Wall Street banks are offloading risky loans to investors â€” when they do, it moves that risk away from the heart of the financial system",,
7084," But there might be a â€œbackdoorâ€ù risk of exposure for banks, he said",,
7084," Thatâ€™s â€œsomething we need to be vigilant about,â€ù he added, and it is something the Fed continues to analyze",,
7084,One backdoor risk is exacerbated by a tactic of some all-too-clever hedge fund managers,,
7084," They buy a little of the debt of risky companies at a discount, and then buy a much larger amount of insurance on that debt â€” so-called â€œcredit default swapsâ€ù â€” to theoretically hedge their risk",,
7084," These wiseguys then do everything they can to force the company into a bankruptcy filing, which contractually triggers the insurance payoff on the debt",,
7084," Since the insurance payment exceeds by far the overall cost of the discounted debt, the hedge fund profits handsomely",,
7084,"The problem, of course, is that the bankruptcy filing can send the company and its creditors, including investors in C",,
7084,L,,
7084,O,,
7084,"s, into a downward spiral, hurting everyone but the architect of the scheme",,
7084," Thatâ€™s what happened to Windstream, an Arkansas-based telecom company that was sent into bankruptcy protection in February",,
7084," These â€œempty creditors,â€ù as Henry Hu, a professor of law at the University of Texas has dubbed them, are rewarded for pushing companies into an otherwise unnecessary bankruptcy",,
7084, Thatâ€™s not the way the markets are supposed to work,,
7084,"After a brief moment of sanity in December, the loopy demand for high-risk debt has once again heated up",,
7084," More than $13 billion of leveraged loans were sold in February, and they will soon worm their way into the financial markets as C",,

7084," The existential question remains: Why do investors fail to learn the harsh lessons about risk, even though the consequences of them still remain so fresh?",,
7085,Weâ€™ve updated this article with the news that Republicans abandoned a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act,,
7085," As House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged, Obamacare is still â€œthe law of the land",,
7085,â€ùDid Obamacare work?Itâ€™s worth reflecting upon after President Trump and House Republicans failed on Friday to repeal and replace the â€œdisasterâ€ù of Obamacare,,
7085,"Ever since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it has been so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate",,
7085," But by looking at the many ways the law has changed health care, itâ€™s possible to hazard some judgments",,
7085,"The answer may vary with your own experience, but it ultimately depends on what you value",,
7085," For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to bring health insurance to more Americans, the rational answer should be: Yes, Obamacare succeeded",,
7085, More than 20 million Americans gained health coverage through the law,,
7085,"For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to make health insurance affordable to all who want it, the rational answer is: No, Obamacare did not achieve uniform affordability",,
7085," Health care in the United States remains the most expensive in the world, and coverage remains out of the financial reach of many Americans",,
7085,"For those who believe the primary goal of the law was to make Americans healthier, the answer has to be: It is too soon to tell",,
7085,"One thing is clear, though â€” the Affordable Care Act has shifted the nationâ€™s baseline expectations for how health care should work",,
7085," Its successes have pushed Republican politicians, like Mr",,
7085," Trump, into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all Americans",,
7085," Its failures have become focal points, too, leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals",,
7085,"Since Republicans took power, public opinion has suddenly tipped in its favor",,
7085," For lots of people, â€œObamacareâ€ù has become synonymous with the health care system itself, with its many miracles and dysfunctions",,
7085,"There are layers beneath each judgment, of course",,
7085," The law was broad and complex, with many goals and provisions",,
7085, This assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments,,

7085,"Providing health coverage to the uninsured was Obamacareâ€™s principal goal, and on that measure, it has succeeded",,
7085," The gain of 20 million insured, based on an Obama administration estimate last year, is probably now even higher",,
7085,"Not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an â€œindividual mandateâ€ù to have insurance or pay a fine",,
7085," Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions",,
7085,The rapid reduction in the number of uninsured Americans has shifted the political debate about health reform,,
7085," In 2009, many Republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many Americans couldnâ€™t get health care",,
7085," Now, Mr",,
7085," Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the Affordable Care Act, although a recent C",,
7085,B,,
7085,O,,
7085, analysis disagreed,,
7085,"Health insurance is supposed to provide access to health care, but it is also a financial product, intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured",,
7085," It is still early to measure the health lawâ€™s full impact, but several studies have found that low-income Americans have become less vulnerable to health-related financial shocks",,
7085," Studies have found that fewer people struggled with medical bills or avoided medical care because of cost, and that medical debt and bills in collections have declined",,
7085,"In an era of growing income and wealth inequality, Obamacare was a starkly redistributive law",,
7085," Not only did it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle incomes, but it also raised taxes on high earners",,
7085," This mix of policies made the law controversial, but it also furthered the Obama administrationâ€™s goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor Americans",,
7085,"Before Obamacare, many products could be called â€œhealth insurance",,
7085,"â€ù Now, health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction, and they canâ€™t cap how much they will pay in a given year",,
7085," Many of the lawâ€™s critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates, but the new rules have increased patientsâ€™ access to services like mental health counseling, contraception and cancer screenings",,
7085,"Obamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes, along with cuts to the federal Medicare program, so that it would save more than it cost",,
7085," A recent forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if left in place, the Affordable Care Act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025",,
7085," (Recent legislation has made some small changes to the lawâ€™s tax provisions, but analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference",,
7085,")Obamacareâ€™s marketplaces and Medicaid expansion make health coverage a good deal for those near the poverty line, but those earning not much more still often struggle to pay health plan premiums, and face deductibles that are much higher than those seen in a typical employer health plan",,
7085," In the lawâ€™s first three years, premiums were lower than expected and grew slowly",,
7085," But prices shot up this year, causing financial shocks for buyers who donâ€™t receive government help in paying their premiums",,
7085, Several analysts believe the increases resulted from recent policy changes and too-low early pricing and may represent a one-time market correction,,
7085, Insurers have also said that they have found the pool of Obamacare enrollees to be sicker and less predictable in their health care needs than expected,,
7085, Some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidies find health care unaffordable,,
7085,President Barack Obama has described the health lawâ€™s markets as being like a Kayak or an Amazon for health insurance,,
7085, Theyâ€™re not,,
7085," Health insurance is easier to shop for now, but it remains a complicated and opaque product, and selecting the right health plan is often frustrating or impossible for Americans unsure of their health needs â€” or unable to decode jargon like â€œout-of-pocket maximumâ€ù or â€œin-network provider",,
7085,"â€ù After picking their insurance, patients can still struggle to use it, and can get stuck with surprise bills or long negotiations with their insurance companies",,
7085,"In many parts of the country, only one insurer even offers health plans, limiting the choices available to consumers",,
7085,The Obamacare marketplaces are set up to encourage customers to frequently switch their health plans to avoid steep price increases,,
7085," The markets have also been turbulent, with insurers going out of business, exiting markets or shifting around their offerings each year",,
7085," That has led to a large fraction of renewing customers who change health plans every year, unable to pick a plan they like and stick with it",,
7085,"Many Obamacare health plans, trying to keep prices competitive, have sharply limited the number of doctors or hospitals they will cover",,
7085, Obamacareâ€™s authors did not expect so-called narrow network plans to become so widespread,,
7085," These have made it hard for some customers to find any plan that includes their favored providers, and means that switching plans often means switching doctors, too",,
7085," The narrower networks, despite their inconveniences, have helped keep insurance prices lower",,
7085,"Health insurance is not the same thing as health, and we still have very limited data about whether the lawâ€™s coverage expansion has lengthened lives or improved their quality in meaningful ways",,
7085, There is some encouraging but very early evidence that low-income people in two states that expanded Medicaid reported improving overall health compared with their low-income neighbors in a state that did not,,
7085," And there is research that more low-income Americans have visited a doctor and have received some basic preventive health services, including prescription contraceptives and treatments for diabetes",,
7085,"But it will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health, or how large that effect may be",,
7085," Even though the law allowed 20 million more people to get coverage, thatâ€™s a small fraction of the nationâ€™s population, and it often takes years for health care services to result in measurable benefits",,
7085,A crucial goal for Mr,,
7085, Obama was â€œbending the cost curveâ€ù and slowing the accelerating cost of health care in the United States,,
7085," Growth in health spending has indeed slowed in the years since Obamacareâ€™s passage, but it is hard to untangle the effects of the health law from other forces affecting health spending, including the Great Recession, rising insurance deductibles and a slowdown in the development of new medical technologies",,
7085," The health lawâ€™s most ardent champions, including Mr",,
7085," Obama, credit it for this change",,
7085, But many economists are uncertain whether the slowdown is a result of the law or a mere coincidence,,
7085,The health law contained many provisions intended to make medical care safer and more evidence-based,,
7085," The health system is still often a dangerous place for patients, but fewer are contracting infections in the hospital, for example, or leaving the hospital only to be readmitted in a few weeks",,
7085," Some trends were underway before the health law passed, so it is difficult to tease out how much change was caused by Obamacare or would have happened anyway",,
7086,"ISTANBUL â€” Turkeyâ€™s two largest political parties ended talks on Thursday without agreeing to form a coalition government, setting the stage for likely new elections and threatening further political instability",,
7086,"In the months since the governing party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lost its absolute majority in the June 7 elections, Turkey has renewed its armed struggle with Kurdish separatists and has more fully embraced war with the militants of the Islamic State in neighboring Syria and Iraq",,
7086, But talks to assemble a new coalition government have gone nowhere,,

7088,"FRANKFURT â€” Eurozone economic growth disappointed on Friday, but donâ€™t blame Greece",,
7088,"Despite all the political haggling and hand-wringing over Greeceâ€™s debt problems, the countryâ€™s economic growth in the second quarter was unexpectedly brisk",,
7088, The country grew more than twice as fast as the eurozone as a whole,,
7088,"That growth spurt could prove fleeting, since part of it reflected panic buying of appliances, cars and other items as Greeks took their money out of ailing Greek banks and spent it on durable goods",,
7088," And the beginning of tourist season also gave Greece a lift, as travelers discovered that the countryâ€™s currency controls did not impede their use of foreign-bank debit and credit cards to eat in tavernas or loll on the beaches of Mykonos",,
7088,"The real trouble for the eurozone lurks elsewhere, especially in the big, slow-growth economies of the Continent, like France and Italy",,
7088,"Germany, too, could begin to waver, even though growth in the most recent quarter was solid",,
7088," The country, which has the eurozoneâ€™s largest economy, is heavily dependent on exports",,
7088," Its industries could start to feel the effects in the coming months of flagging demand from China, an important customer for German machinery and cars",,
7088,The eurozone economy continues to gain ground as it slowly recovers from the regional recession that followed the global financial crisis of 2008 and the eurozoneâ€™s own debt-related problems in the years that followed,,
7088,"As a group, the 19 eurozone countries grew at an annual rate of 1",,
7088,"3 percent from April through June, down from 1",,
7088,5 percent the previous quarter,,
7088, Greece grew 3,,
7088,"1 percent, from only 0",,
7088,1 percent at the beginning of the year,,
7088,But Fridayâ€™s data showed that the recovery remained hesitant and that it was far too weak to quickly bring down the eurozoneâ€™s unemployment rate of more than 11 percent,,
7088,"By both measures â€” growth and joblessness â€” the eurozone continues to lag the recovery in the United States, where the latest data showed a growth rate of 2",,
7088,3 percent and unemployment of 5,,

7088,"Greece, which accounts for a puny percentage of the eurozoneâ€™s G",,
7088,D,,
7088,P,,
7088,", had little impact on the most recent growth figures",,
7088," That point might be easy to overlook, considering all the political and financial capital that eurozone leaders have expended to keep Athens afloat",,
7088,"But foreign banks and other nongovernment investors have little remaining risk in Greece, having taken most of their money out of the country and gotten rid of the Greek bonds that they owned",,
7088,"Any broader financial market turmoil has been held at bay by the stimulus efforts of the European Central Bank, the central bank concluded in a summary of its monetary policy meeting last month, published on Thursday",,
7088,"â€œSome spillover effects from the events in Greece had been observed in the euro area bond and equity markets,â€ù the summary said, paraphrasing a presentation on the economic situation by BenoÃ®t CÅ“urÃ©, a member of the central bankâ€™s executive board",,
7088," â€œBut, over all, contagion to other euro area countries had been limited",,
7088,"â€ùFor European companies like Miele, a German maker of refrigerators, stoves, washing machines and other appliances, Greece has essentially been a nonevent",,
7088,"â€œThe global economy showed itself to be more robust than expected, in view of political and economic crisis spots like Russia and the Ukraine, the Middle East and Greece,â€ù the company said in a statement on Thursday, as it reported that sales rose 8 percent to 3",,
7088,"5 billion euros, or about $3",,
7088,"9 billion, in the fiscal year that ended June 30",,
7088,"For Miele and many other exporters in the eurozone, any shock waves from Greece and from other trouble spots have been outweighed by positive factors, especially low energy prices and a fall in the value of the euro against the dollar and against other major currencies",,
7088, A cheaper euro makes products from the eurozone less expensive for customers abroad,,
7088, It also increases the value of sales in foreign currencies when they are converted into euros,,
7088,"â€œThe big question is when the Chinese slowdown will start to hit the German economy,â€ù JÃ¶rg KrÃ_mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients on Friday",,
7088,Growth in the French economy was flat compared with the previous quarter,,
7088," French consumer spending was weaker than expected, economists said, despite a fall in the price of energy",,
7088," Typically, consumers spend what they have saved from gasoline and other energy costs on other goods, but that stimulus seems to have faded in France",,
7088,"The lack of any quarterly growth in France suggested that the biggest problem for the eurozone economy was no longer the smaller countries like Greece, Ireland or Portugal, which preoccupied policy makers in recent years",,
7088," Rather, it is the large, core countries that account for most of the eurozone economy but are unable to muster sustained growth",,
7088,Growth in Italy during the quarter was also disappointing,,
7088," And while Spain continued to emerge from economic crisis, unemployment there remained above 22 percent, second in Europe only to Greeceâ€™s rate of about 25 percent",,
7088,"Economists fault Italy and France for being too slow to chisel away at the regulations that protect entrenched, politically powerful groups from competition and that impede entrepreneurship",,
7088,â€œTodayâ€™s G,,
7088,D,,
7088,P,,
7088," data show that the eurozone recovery must not be taken for granted,â€ù Tom Rogers, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in an email",,
7088," That is particularly true, he added, â€œin countries where little has been done to improve competitiveness and the climate for job creation",,
7088,â€ùMuch of Europeâ€™s dynamism is coming from countries in the east,,
7088," Latvia, a member of the eurozone, had the strongest growth in the European Union, while Poland and the Czech Republic, which are not in the eurozone, also performed well",,
7088," In the 28 countries of the European Union, first-quarter growth was 1",,
7088,7 percent on an annual basis,,
7088,"Only one European Union country, Finland, registered a fall in economic output in the quarter",,
7088," Finland, a member of the eurozone, continues to suffer from problems at Nokia, once the countryâ€™s flagship company, which lost its dominance of the mobile handset market to Apple several years ago",,
7088," Last year, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft, which has dismissed thousands of workers",,
7088,Finlandâ€™s economic problems help explain why there is strong popular opposition in that country to more aid for Greece,,
7088,"Greece is expected to fall back into recession this year, as currency controls undercut consumer spending",,
7088, But there are genuine bright spots in the Greek economy,,
7088, Tourists have continued to flock to Greeceâ€™s beaches despite the political turmoil,,
7088,"The TUI Group, Germanyâ€™s largest provider of package tours, said on Thursday that bookings to Greece were up from last year, although it did not give precise figures",,
7088,"Greeceâ€™s reduced ability to instill concern in investors is probably good for Europe and for the world, but not necessarily for the Greeks",,
7088," If leaders of the other 18 countries in the eurozone no longer fear contagion from Greece, they have even less incentive to risk their taxpayersâ€™ money to prop up that countryâ€™s economy",,

7089, But by then he had already absorbed many hits to the head during eight years of Pop Warner football and one year playing as a high school freshman,,
7089,"By 2014, Ms",,
7089," Archieâ€™s son, Paul Bright Jr",,
7089,", was 24, and had done something out of character, his mother said: He bought a motorcycle off Craigslist, despite having no riding experience",,
7089," He fixed it up, and rode it fast without a license or insurance",,
7089, On Labor Day that year he T-boned another vehicle and died,,

7089,"Now, California state lawmakers are being asked to bar children under 12 from playing organized tackle football â€” a requirement supporters say will protect their brains from unnecessary injury and trauma",,
7089, Ms,,
7089," Archie, who had been working to make sports safer long before her sonâ€™s death, supports the bill, but thinks the age limit should be pushed even higher",,
7089,"â€œIf Iâ€™m wrong there is going to be less brain-injury exposure,â€ù she said",,
7089," â€œIf theyâ€™re wrong, kids can die",,
7089,â€ùA fact sheet in support of the bill â€” known as the Safe Youth Football Act â€” says children who wait until they are 12 to play tackle football decrease their risk of â€œlife-impacting brain damageâ€ù by 50 percent,,
7089," Doctors have also noted that head hits are more damaging to young players because their brains are not fully developed, and are less capable of fully repairing themselves",,
7089," Similar legislation has been proposed in Illinois, Maryland and New York, officials said",,
7089,"But passing anti-football laws, even at the state level, can be an uphill battle",,
7089," Despite a decline in youth football participation over the past decade, the sport remains very popular",,
7089," A Facebook group titled Save Youth Football â€” California already has more than 4,000 members",,
7089," On the page, critics of the proposed law call it government overreach, share stories about the value of football and question the research into its harm",,
7089,"â€œIâ€™m opposed to anything thatâ€™s going to tell me how to raise my kids thatâ€™s not a black-and-white situation,â€ù Nick Hardwick, a former center for the San Diego Chargers who now is the teamâ€™s radio analyst, told The San Diego Union-Tribune",,

7090,"From Bill Clintonâ€™s first election through Barack Obamaâ€™s second, a Democrat won the western Ohio county that includes Dayton â€” Montgomery County â€” in all six presidential elections, including those that the party lost nationally",,
7090,But now the county has largely flipped to the Republicans,,
7090," On Tuesday, Mike DeWine â€” Ohioâ€™s governor-elect â€” won Montgomery narrowly, just as Donald Trump had two years ago",,
7090, And the Dayton areaâ€™s drift is part of something much larger: Democrats are getting hammered outside of major metropolitan areas,,
7090,Thatâ€™s the main reason Ohio has gone from being a swing state to a more clearly Republican one,,
7090, (Trump won it by 8 percentage points in 2016,,
7090,") Itâ€™s the main reason Democrats appear to have lost high-profile races this week in Florida, Georgia and Texas and why they also lost Senate seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota",,
7090,"[Listen to â€œThe Argumentâ€ù podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt",,
7090,]Itâ€™s a huge problem for the party,,
7090, Democrats donâ€™t need to win in most rural areas,,
7090," But they do need to avoid losing by 50 or 60 percentage points, as they now often do in some of the counties near Dayton",,
7090," And the party needs to win in more small and medium-sized cities and in more counties like Montgomery, which happens to be Ohioâ€™s fifth most populated county",,
7090,"If the party doesnâ€™t do better in these places, it can still win presidential elections",,
7090," But it will struggle mightily to retake the Senate, which next year could have as many as 54 Republican members",,
7090," Without the Senate, ambitious federal legislation â€” to fight climate change, reduce inequality, expand voting rights and so on â€” will be impossible",,
7090," Getting judges confirmed, including to the Supreme Court, will become very difficult",,
7090,The Democratic Party simply cannot write off nonmetropolitan America â€” and try to overwhelm it with a rising urban and suburban coalition,,
7090,"So how can the party do better? For starters, it needs to try harder",,
7090,It should come up with a serious agenda to combat what Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute calls the â€œfull-on crisisâ€ù in rural America,,
7090," That crisis, he says, includes expensive health care, bad transportation options, job opportunities wrecked by chain stores, a struggling agriculture economy and, of course, the opioid epidemic",,
7090," Tom Vilsack, the Democrat and former Iowa governor, has come up with a four-pillar rural strategy thatâ€™s based around agriculture, as Michael Tomasky pointed out in a Times Op-Ed this week",,
7090,"Smaller cities donâ€™t have all of these problems, but they do have many",,
7090," Iâ€™d add one issue to these lists, which bedevils both rural America and smaller cities: educational opportunity",,
7090," In a mini-essay about Ohio on Twitter yesterday, Alec MacGillis of ProPublica pointed out that the stateâ€™s investment in education has actually declined over the past decade",,
7090,"â€œOhio,â€ù MacGillis writes, â€œhas an astonishing array of these small cities and towns â€” all with handsome old courthouses, coherent downtowns and grand Victorians, and almost all of them in a condition that breaks your heart",,
7090, And thatâ€™s not to mention the truly desperate rural areas of southern [and southeast] Ohio,,
7090,â€ùIt is possible for Democrats to do better in places like Dayton and in rural areas,,
7090," On Tuesday night, they got to see a model â€” in Ohio",,
7090," Senator Sherrod Brown won re-election with a populist, jobs-focused message that focuses on economic class, not cultural issues",,
7090, He won Montgomery County by more than 11 percentage points,,
7090," In Minnesota, Senator Amy Klobuchar, also a Democrat, won re-election by a landslide",,
7090," In Iowa, Wisconsin and parts of the West, Democrats also figured out how to hold down their rural losses",,
7090,"Labor unions played a role in many of these wins, as Slateâ€™s Jamelle Bouie notes",,
7090," â€œMidwestern campaigns capitalized on still-existing labor infrastructure to mobilize union members and bring them back into the Democratic fold,â€ù he writes",,
7090,"I understand why talk of rural America often frustrates progressives: Rural America â€” which is, of course, overwhelmingly white â€” already has outsize political power in this country, thanks to the Senate, the Electoral College and the privileged role that Iowa and New Hampshire play in presidential elections",,
7090, But life in rural areas and small cities hasnâ€™t exactly been easy in recent years,,
7090," In virtually every measurable way â€” incomes, wealth, education, health, longevity â€” large metropolitan areas have done better",,
7090,"Democrats should, by all means, continue fighting for the issues that matter to metropolitan America, like civil rights",,
7090, But there is a clear moral case for devoting more attention to small-town America at the same time,,
7090, There is also a self-interested political case for Democrats,,
7090,"Related: Doing better outside of major metropolitan areas would also help the party win more seats in state legislatures â€” which, as Bryce Covert notes in The Times, is where a lot of policy gets made",,
7090," Her list includes the minimum wage, paid leave, clean energy, voting rights, criminal justice, gun safety and education",,

7091, No flavors,,
7091, No sugar,,

7091,"TOO BUSY FOR WORDS  My ideal Sunday would be drinking coffee and doing the Times crossword, but we are usually too busy for that",,
7091," I also like to bake, especially sourdough bread",,
7091, That takes a long weekend because I have to set the dough on a Friday and let it rise until itâ€™s ready to bake on Sunday,,

7091,WORKING THE LAND We grow vegetables in our backyard and in planters,,

7091,THE ROUTE Weâ€™re very lucky to live near a greenway that links parks in Queens and goes out into Brooklyn,,
7091," We usually start in Cunningham Park and then cycle out to the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway, my favorite part of the ride",,
7091," Then, we ride home and have lunch and get ready to grocery shop",,
7091, I keep a calendar of what nights weâ€™ll be at home that week so I can plan meals ahead,,
7091,"GET ON THE BUS We donâ€™t have a car, which my family canâ€™t believe, so we take the bus to a Korean superstore and pick up groceries there and shop at some Italian specialty markets around the corner from the superstore",,
7091,"MYSTERY FOODS Sometimes, I pick up a can of some food and I have no idea what it is, so Iâ€™ll buy it",,
7091, I like doing that,,
7091, The Italian markets have amazing baked goods,,
7091, I try not to buy them because they disappear quickly at home,,
7091," There are also some other small grocery stores, including an Armenian one where I buy tahini",,

7092,"Parit is a small town of roughly 2,000 people in the state of Perak, deep in the rural heartland of Malaysia, with no distinguishing feature other than its attractive location on the banks of a muddy river, which served as the backdrop to a few scenes in the 1999 movie â€œAnna and the King",,
7092,"â€ù Once a convenient and bustling stopping-off point on the winding road from Ipoh, the state capital, to Taiping in the north, Parit suffered from the construction of the North-South Expressway in the 1990s, which diverted passing trade away from the town",,
7092,"Today the shops that line its two main streets are either closed for good or open only erratically, the paint on their stuccoed facades faded and patchy with moss â€” a poignant reminder of the decline of rural life in Malaysia over the past three decades",,
7092, Parit is among the hundreds of country towns and villages that have suffered from the relentless urbanization that has accompanied Malaysiaâ€™s remarkable economic success since the late 1980s,,
7092,"I spent my school vacations there for a decade, starting in the late 1970s, staying with my grandparents who owned the general store",,
7092," My uncle still runs it, though the shop is half-empty these days, the childrenâ€™s toys that remain are covered in dust, and the cellophane wrapped up around the small pile of school uniforms is yellowing",,
7092," Like most young people who grew up there, my cousins have all moved to cities to find work â€” to Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru or Singapore",,
7092,The speed with which Malaysia has transformed itself from a sleepy former British colony into what the World Bank calls an â€œupper middle incomeâ€ù country has been impressive: The countryâ€™s average growth rate of 6 percent over 25 years has made it the richest state (by G,,
7092,D,,
7092,P,,
7092, per capita) in Southeast Asia after Singapore,,
7092," Economic growth has been accompanied by a breathtaking rate of urbanization: In 1960, about two-thirds of the population lived in rural areas; today, 74 percent of Malaysians live in cities",,
7092,This growth poses a major organizational challenge for Malaysiaâ€™s large cities,,
7092," On most days, rush-hour traffic in Kuala Lumpur brings the capital to a near-standstill",,
7092," Even in the sprawling middle-class suburb of Petaling Jaya, cars inch along bumper-to-bumper between the school run and dinnertime, which is hardly surprising given that there are at least twice as many registered cars as people in the Federal Territory, the administrative area that includes Kuala Lumpur",,
7092,The crime rate has soared over the past decade,,
7092, The continuing rise in real estate prices â€” 30 to 35 percent between 2011 and 2013 â€” is making homeownership increasingly difficult for even young professionals,,
7092, Kuala Lumpurâ€™s burgeoning middle class has plenty of reason to grumble,,
7092,"But its problems pale in comparison with those faced by Kuala Lumpurâ€™s underprivileged, a class that Malaysiaâ€™s Economic Planning Unit calls the â€œurban vulnerable groupâ€ù: people who possess only the most basic schooling and are either unemployed or earn less than $780 a month per household",,
7092," Although slums have largely been eradicated from central Kuala Lumpur, dozens of townships formed of cramped public and flimsy zinc-roofed housing fill the outskirts of the city",,
7092," In the fringes of Setapak that I passed through recently, small children play on dumpsites not far from shanties made of tin and salvaged wood planks",,
7092," In the low-income suburbs of Sentul and Taman Medan, disaffected youths known as mat rempit indulge in illegal street racing on jazzed-up scooters",,
7092,The rapid expansion of Malaysiaâ€™s cities requires a radical rethink of the way Malaysians want to live,,
7092," That in turn requires examining whether we are a country of sophisticated urbanites (think Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore) or a country of rural folk, only recently converted to the excitement of city life, but craving, nonetheless, more space, time and leisure",,
7092," Kuala Lumpur might boast an array of Western-style entertainment options, but its residentsâ€™ preferred dining and shopping venues are the night markets and open-air mamak stalls that are the cityâ€™s link to life in the provinces",,
7092," In every luxury mall, the busiest section by far is the food court, an air-conditioned imitation of the hawker centers whose roots lie in the countrysideâ€™s casual eating traditions",,
7092,"This call for a reassessment isnâ€™t about nostalgia, or a naÃ¯ve rant against development, but an invitation to reconsider the potential role of the countryside in Malaysiaâ€™s progress",,
7092," Improvements in infrastructure and telecommunications mean that small towns are now within easy reach: Parit is less than a three-hour drive from Kuala Lumpur, thanks to the very highway that first ruined its fortunes",,
7092," The provinces offer space, affordable housing and greater social integration",,
7092,"Large provincial towns such as Ipoh, 30 miles from Parit, are beginning to experience revivals, the shops and restaurants in its previously run-down historic old town being rejuvenated thanks to real estate investment by Kuala Lumpur dwellers in search of a higher quality of life",,
7092, But that regeneration has yet to trickle down to the smaller towns in more rural locations farther afield,,
7092,"Greater investment in Internet and telephone connectivity in the provinces would mean that Parit and other similar towns could easily participate in Malaysiaâ€™s fast-growing online-based small-business sector and begin to contribute to, rather than be excluded from, the countryâ€™s economic growth",,
7092," The Malaysian expression for the act of visiting relatives in the countryside is â€œBalik Kampung,â€ù which translates literally as â€œReturn to the Village",,
7092,â€ù This might be a good moment to do just that,,

7093," In 1929, Munthe wrote â€œThe Story of San Michele,â€ù a best-selling memoir translated into more than 40 languages that included run-ins with ghosts and guiding voices as he pursued his dream of the villa",,
7093,"Following Muntheâ€™s death in 1949, the villa was transformed into a tiny Swedish consulate and a cultural institute hosting the countryâ€™s artists, including, most recently, the Stockholm-born, Rome-based artist and illustrator Liselotte Watkins",,
7093," Entitled â€œSbiadito,â€ù or sun-faded, like the timeworn statuary of the villaâ€™s loggia that houses her works, her show features a series of Watkinsâ€™s vases, reclaimed from flea markets and painted with her signature Cubist women in a pastel palette",,
7093," A collaborator with Prada, Marimekko, Bitossi and others, Watkins decided to celebrate this personal collection with an intimate meal in the villaâ€™s wisteria-trellised colonnade",,
7093,"[Sign up here for the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting now",,
7093,"]Two dozen invitees dined on traditional Italian dishes of panzanella, caponata, and Caprese salad, seated in the chapel and surrounded by Muntheâ€™s centuries-old wooden saints and iron candelabras, before ambling out to the marble terrace for glasses of the local Greco di Tufo wine and end-of-the-night chats",,
7093," Here, Watkins shares her tips for entertaining at the Villa San Michele and beyond",,
7093,"With the onus of an exhibition to mount, Watkins delegated the party planning wherever possible",,
7093," For the dinnerâ€™s tabletop design, she turned to J",,
7093,J,,
7093," Martin, a friend who shares her aesthetic passions, and who creates clothing and homewares in revived vintage prints for her LaDoubleJ line",,
7093," â€œWe both appreciate bold, feminine design and fashion",,
7093," Weâ€™re both vintage freaks,â€ù said Martin",,
7093," â€œSo when Liselotte called me and said I need to dress an empty church, I knew exactly what she needed",,
7093,"â€ù From the table mockups Martin sent over, Watkins chose LaDoubleJâ€™s newly released â€œWildbirdâ€ù print, first designed by the Como silk brand Mantero in the 1940s",,
7093," Its swirling pattern was repeated in the green tablecloth, the purple cloth napkins and a rainbow of plates â€” a surprisingly Scandinavian look Watkins termed â€œSwedish cottage",,
7093,"â€ùâ€œI believe in dressing for the occasion,â€ù said the artist, wearing a billowing LaDoubleJ skirt in bold green and yellow stripes â€” a dead ringer for the seaside umbrellas of Capriâ€™s beach clubs",,
7093," Equally appropriate, Kristina Kappelin, a former Swedish TV reporter and the director of the Villa San Michele, wore a caftan by the Stockholm brand Rodebjer that was printed with a vivid design by Watkins that recalled her vase paintings",,
7093,"How does an artist approach a dinner party? â€œI like the still-life aspect,â€ù said Watkins, â€œSo if Iâ€™m making the meal, I like little finger food that I can compose",,
7093," Olga, however, is not a believer in finger food",,
7093,"â€ù Olga Mottola, who was tasked with the cooking on this occasion, is the veteran caretaker of this villa, a 70-something-year-old traditionalist who sticks to abundant Italian dishes",,
7093," With help from Kappelinâ€™s Italian husband, she prepared local classics, including an octopus dish with potato and basil â€” made with a wine cork in the boiling water to help soften the tentacles, one of Mottolaâ€™s cooking secrets",,
7093," The home-style approach is â€œso much more my style, and so much more fun,â€ù said Watkins",,
7093," â€œWith home cooking, a meal becomes a family affair",,
7093,"â€ùâ€œBuying flowers is a bit weird to me,â€ù said Watkins",,

7096, Then came the great urban rebirth: a wave of reinvestment coupled with a plunge in crime rates that has left many major cities to enjoy a sort of post-fear existence,,

7096,The violence and disorder have fed broader setbacks,,

7096," Why should he, he argued, when he saw young men on dirt bikes flying through intersections while police officers sat in cruisers doing nothing?Explaining all this to people outside Baltimore is difficult, not only because the experience is alien to those even in cities just up or down the Interstate from us (though a handful of cities elsewhere, like Chicago and St",,
7096," Louis, have experienced their own waves of recent violence, albeit less dramatically than Baltimore)",,
7096, Itâ€™s also because the national political discourse lacks a vocabulary for the cityâ€™s ills,,

7096,"On the left, in contrast, Baltimoreâ€™s recent woes have been largely overlooked, partly because they present a challenge to those who start from the assumption that policing is inherently suspect",,
7096," The national progressive story of Baltimore during this era of criminal-justice reform has been the story of the police excesses that led to Grayâ€™s death and the uprising, not the surge of violence that has overtaken the city ever since",,
7096," As a result, Baltimore has been left mostly on its own to contend with what has been happening, which has amounted to nothing less than a failure of order and governance the likes of which few American cities have seen in years",,
7096,"To understand how things in Baltimore have gotten so bad, you need to first understand how, not so long ago, they got better",,
7096," Violence was epidemic in Baltimore in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as it was in many other cities, as crack intruded into a drug market long dominated by heroin",,
7096," In 1993, the city crossed the 350-homicide mark",,
7096, These were the years that inspired â€œThe Wire,,
7096,"â€ù They also gave rise to Martin Oâ€™Malley, a city councilman who was elected mayor on an anti-crime platform in 1999",,
7096,"Oâ€™Malley set about implementing what was then known as the New York model: zero tolerance for open-air drug markets, data-centric â€œCompStatâ€ù meetings to track crime and hold police commanders accountable and more resources for law enforcement paired with tougher discipline for officers who abused their power",,
7096," By the time Oâ€™Malley, a Democrat, was elected governor of Maryland in 2006, crime rates, including murders, had fallen across the board, but at a cost",,
7096," Arrests had jumped to 101,000 in 2005 from 81,000 in 1999 â€” leaving a city full of young men with criminal records and months and years away from jobs and families",,
7096,This perturbed a police detective named Tony Barksdale,,
7096," At the time a colonel in his mid-30s, Barksdale, a bald, bearish man with a lugubrious manner, grew up in a rough section of West Baltimore",,
7096," â€œI saw my first guy get shot at a football tryout at Franklin Square,â€ù near his home, he told me when I met him for lunch last spring in the cityâ€™s Canton neighborhood",,
7096," His own block was relatively safe, however, because a police officer lived on it",,
7096," Barksdale was drifting through Coppin State College, â€œblowing Pell grants,â€ù when he saw a bunch of young black cops on the street one day",,
7096, The sight inspired him to sign up himself,,
7096,"Early in 2007, he proposed a more targeted approach to policing to Sheila Dixon, the City Council president who finished Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s term as mayor after he was elected governor",,
7096," Dixon, like Barksdale a product of the cityâ€™s black working class, agreed with Barksdaleâ€™s vision for reducing the murders without mass arrests",,
7096," â€œShe said, â€˜How long will it take you?â€™â€‰â€ù Barksdale recalls",,
7096," â€œI said, â€˜One day",,
7096,"â€™â€‰â€ùFred Bealefeld, Dixonâ€™s new police commissioner, promoted Barksdale to deputy of operations â€” he was the youngest deputy commissioner in the cityâ€™s history â€” and Barksdale got to work",,
7096," He developed plainclothes units with a more surgical approach to policing, which targeted the most violent corners and worked with homicide detectives to arrest the people whose names surfaced in connection with killings",,
7096," He and Bealefeld met weekly with top-ranking staff members in the mayorâ€™s office and sat down with top city officials every couple of weeks in CitiStat meetings â€” the municipal equivalent of CompStat â€” where Bealefeld was quizzed on overtime costs, recruiting and other markers of departmental health",,
7096," Every couple of weeks, representatives of the police, the stateâ€™s attorneyâ€™s office and others met to review data on firearms prosecutions",,
7096,"Arrests fell by a third from 2006 to 2011 â€” and homicides plummeted as well, to 197 in 2011, the cityâ€™s first time under 200 in almost four decades",,
7096, A 2018 study by Johns Hopkins found that the new approach to policing was the cityâ€™s most effective in recent years,,
7096," â€œBaltimore had it going on,â€ù Barksdale told me",,
7096,"But while Dixon had carried on Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s government-accountability practices, she proved less than ethical in her own affairs",,
7096," A few years into Barksdaleâ€™s efforts, she was charged by the state prosecutor with theft and fraud",,
7096, The prosecutor had scrutinized contracts and jobs her friends and relatives had received from the city â€” investigations that led to the discovery that she had personally used hundreds of dollars in gift cards solicited from developers and meant for poor children,,
7096,"Dixon was convicted and resigned, and was replaced by the City Councilâ€™s president, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, an Oberlin- and University of Maryland School of Law-educated daughter of a powerful state legislator",,
7096," Rawlings-Blake, a more reserved leader than Dixon, wanted Bealefeld to communicate with the public more often than he was inclined to but also less candidly; a white cop from a family full of them, Bealefeld was known for his blunt talk about â€œpunksâ€ù and â€œknuckleheads",,
7096,"â€ù In 2012, he retired, as did two of his closest City Hall allies, and Barksdale became interim commissioner",,
7096,"Barksdale interviewed for the permanent job, but Rawlings-Blake instead hired Anthony Batts, the former police chief in Oakland, Calif",,
7096," Batts had resigned in Oakland amid tensions with the mayor and federal court monitors, but he had a doctorate and spoke fluently about the need for community relations",,
7096, Battsâ€™s profile suited a city that wanted to believe that its most violent days were behind it,,
7096," Barksdale didnâ€™t find out he had been passed over until he got a call from Justin Fenton, The Sunâ€™s lead police reporter",,
7096,"When the Black Lives Matter movement transformed the debate about policing in 2014, Batts embraced an image as a reformer",,
7096, He attended street festivals in full uniform,,
7096, He reined in Barksdaleâ€™s plainclothes teams after a series in The Sun reported how much the city was spending to resolve lawsuits over rough arrests â€” more than $5 million since 2011,,
7096," On Bealefeld and Barksdaleâ€™s watch, there had also been a rise in shootings by police officers, which roughly doubled between 2006 and 2007 before dropping to earlier levels â€” a fact Barksdale remains unapologetic about",,
7096," â€œTo hit the brakes on crime, there will be police-involved shootings,â€ù he recalls telling Dixon and Bealefeld",,
7096, â€œI know their mind-set,,
7096, Theyâ€™ll respect you if youâ€™re willing to die just like them,,
7096, And there are people who just donâ€™t get that,,
7096,â€ùIt was a controversial approach and one that Batts did not subscribe to,,
7096," He replaced much of the command staff, and other people left on their own",,
7096," Among them was Barksdale, who retired at age 42",,
7096," â€œI like a commissioner who says, â€˜Look, we have people in the community we have to arrest,â€™â€‰â€ù Barksdale told me",,
7096, â€œNot cops out here dancing in full uniform,,
7096,"â€ùPolitical developments, meanwhile, had eroded foundations of the departmentâ€™s recent successes, which depended heavily on coordination with City Hall and state and federal prosecutors, as well as with Marylandâ€™s parole-and-probation office and other state agencies that might not have been as attentive to the city if the governor had not been a former Baltimore mayor",,
7096," But in 2014, Maryland elected Larry Hogan, a Republican suburban real estate developer, as Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s successor for governor",,
7096, Hogan put less pressure on state offices to work closely with the cityâ€™s police,,
7096," And the new stateâ€™s attorney, after an upset victory in a low-turnout Democratic primary, was Marilyn Mosby, a 34-year-old former assistant prosecutor who had run with the apparent goal of shaking up the cityâ€™s law-enforcement bureaucracy",,
7096, She jettisoned not only top deputies but also many prosecutors; more left of their own accord,,
7096," Over time, senior members of her office became a less-frequent presence at CompStat and other meetings with law-enforcement partners",,
7096, (Mosbyâ€™s office did not respond to requests for official comment,,
7096,")In her campaign, Mosby called for diverting more nonviolent drug offenders into treatment",,
7096," One halfway house used for this purpose was in West Baltimore, and drug dealers had zeroed in on its residents as a clientele, according to a member of Mosbyâ€™s staff",,
7096," On March 17, 2015, Mosbyâ€™s office asked a police commander to target a nearby intersection for â€œenhancedâ€ù drug enforcement",,
7096," A few weeks later, two officers on bike patrol a couple of blocks south of that intersection encountered a man named Freddie Gray",,
7096,"Among the deaths at police officersâ€™ hands that animated the Black Lives Matter movement in its early stages, Grayâ€™s was uniquely ambiguous",,
7096," He was not shot, as were Laquan McDonald in Chicago, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo",,
7096,", Tamir Rice in Cleveland and Walter Scott in North Charleston, S",,
7096,C,,
7096," All that is known for certain is this: When he encountered the police officers, Gray â€” who had engaged in low-level dealing over the years â€” ran",,
7096," When the police gave chase and tackled him, they found a small knife in his pocket and placed him under arrest",,
7096," Gray was put in the back of a police van shackled and unbuckled, in violation of a new department policy",,
7096," When the van arrived at the Western Districtâ€™s headquarters, Gray was unconscious with a nearly severed spinal cord",,
7096, He died seven days later,,
7096,Protesters took to the streets after Grayâ€™s death,,
7096," Batts, who had canceled a European vacation he was scheduled to take the previous week, appealed to Hoganâ€™s new state police chief for reinforcements, but he received an offer of only about 120 officers, far fewer than he hoped for",,
7096," The demonstrations proceeded mostly peacefully for a week until Saturday, April 25, when rowdy baseball fans headed to Camden Yards â€” including out-of-town Red Sox fans â€” taunted a group of protesters who had marched into downtown",,
7096," In the mayhem that ensued, some teenagers and young men smashed in police cruisersâ€™ windshields and bar windows and looted a 7-Eleven",,
7096,"The police held back, making only about a dozen arrests",,
7096," It appeared as if Batts wanted to set himself apart from the heavy-handed tactics in Ferguson, where anti-riot police officers bristled with military hardware",,
7096," That night, Batts, who declined to be interviewed on the record for this article, hailed his officersâ€™ limited response to the disorderly crowd amassed downtown",,
7096," â€œWeâ€™re taking our time to give them the opportunity to leave,â€ù he told reporters",,
7096,"Bealefeld, Battsâ€™s predecessor, told me: â€œThere were people inside police leadership circles that were being celebrated for their restraint",,
7096," People were thinking, â€˜Aha, we want to be seen in that light",,
7096,"â€™â€‰â€ù But this hands-off response drew resentment within the department, where many were already disgruntled with the commissioner from California",,
7096," â€œIt would have been over that night if weâ€™d been able to do our jobs,â€ù one veteran officer who attended a command briefing that weekend told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters",,
7096, â€œThey let it fester,,
7096,"â€ùThe approach was notably different two days later, the day of Grayâ€™s funeral",,
7096," The police were on edge over two separate rumors â€” a social-media call for a youth â€œpurge,â€ù or rampage, into downtown after school let out, and talk of gangs uniting to attack police officers",,
7096, The F,,
7096,B,,
7096,I,,
7096," quickly determined that the second threat was baseless, but Batts responded heavily to the first rumor, sending 300 officers to confront students at a big west-side transit hub after school and stand guard outside the adjacent shopping mall",,
7096," Someone in authority â€” to this day, officials wonâ€™t say who â€” ordered a shutdown of transit service",,
7096," Some of the stranded teenagers started throwing rocks and bricks at the police, who lacked proper protective gear and had received little riot-response training",,
7096," Before long, a CVS pharmacy a mile away was on fire",,
7096,"In hindsight, itâ€™s hard to avoid the conclusion that the riot was probably avoidable â€” if Batts had had more officers at his disposal, if his officers had been better trained, if there hadnâ€™t been the seeming overreaction to Mondayâ€™s swirling rumors",,
7096, But within three hours it was out of his control,,
7096, Governor Hogan dispatched National Guard troops and established a command center in West Baltimore,,
7096," That Friday, Mosby â€” whose policing request may very well have led to Grayâ€™s arrest â€” held a televised news conference announcing a long list of serious charges against six officers, including â€œdepraved heart murder,â€ù or causing death through indifference",,
7096," â€œI have heard your call for â€˜no justice, no peace,â€™â€‰â€ù she declared",,
7096,"Her announcement of charges â€” based on an investigation her own office conducted, not trusting the departmentâ€™s â€” helped stanch further unrest, but it delivered a profound blow to morale among rank-and-file officers, who were already aggrieved over their leadershipâ€™s handling of the riot, in which 130 officers were injured",,
7096," Officers bridled at the ringing, declamatory tone of her announcement",,
7096," â€œIt was the way she did it â€” the grandstanding,â€ù the veteran officer told me",,
7096,"â€œCops donâ€™t necessarily stop in their tracks because another cop is charged in a crime,â€ù Kevin Davis, one of Battsâ€™s deputies at the time, told me",,
7096," â€œTypically itâ€™s a bad cop, a crook, a drug dealer or a drunk or someone who abuses his wife",,
7096, But when these cops got charged criminally and the probable cause was not easily understood by the rank and file â€” that gave them a sense of dread,,
7096,"â€ùThe departmentâ€™s officers responded swiftly, by doing nothing",,
7096," In Baltimore it came to be known as â€œthe pullbackâ€ù: a monthslong retreat from policing, a protest that was at once undeclared and unmistakably deliberate â€” encouraged, some top officials in the department at the time believe, by the local police union",,
7096, Many officers responded to calls for service but refused to undertake any â€œofficer-initiatedâ€ù action,,
7096, Cruisers rolled by trouble spots without stopping or didnâ€™t roll by at all,,
7096," Compounding the situation, some of the officers hospitalized in the riot remained out on medical leave",,
7096, Arrests plunged by more than half from the same month a year before,,
7096," The head of the police union, Lt",,
7096," Gene Ryan, called the pullback justifiable: â€œOfficers may be second-guessing themselves,â€ù he told The Sun",,
7096," â€œQuestioning, if I make this stop or this arrest, will I be prosecuted?â€ùRay Kelly, a West Baltimore community activist, had achieved measured success in building relationships with officers along the drug-riddled Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, where his organization had an office",,
7096," Suddenly, those officers were gone",,
7096," â€œWe saw a pullback in this community for over a month where it was up to the community to police the community,â€ù Kelly told me",,
7096," â€œAnd quite frankly, we were outgunned",,
7096,"â€ù In the vacuum, crews took new corners and people settled old scores",,
7096, Not a single person was killed on the day of the rioting,,
7096," But the following month, May, would conclude with 41 homicides â€” the most the city had experienced in a month since the 1970s, and more than the city of Boston would have for the entire year",,
7096,"Late that month, Batts admitted he was having trouble getting officers to do their job",,
7096," â€œI talked to them again about character and what character means,â€ù he told me and other reporters following a City Council hearing",,
7096, He grew so mortified over the pullback that he started wearing suits instead of his uniform,,
7096," By Julyâ€™s end, 45 people had been killed during the month, and Rawlings-Blake had replaced Batts with Davis",,
7096," The department was hemorrhaging officers now, at all ranks",,
7096,[Read about the prosecution of six officers for the death of Freddie Gray,,
7096,"]Amid the upheavals of 2015, Shantay Guy found herself recalling, as a girl on North Avenue in the 1980s, diving under a car during a shooting, getting oil on her favorite shirt",,
7096, Her work at T,,
7096, Rowe Price suddenly seemed unacceptably rarefied,,
7096," â€œIâ€™m not doing enough,â€ù she thought",,
7096, â€œIâ€™m doing a lot to make rich people richer,,
7096,"â€ùShe approached a friend, Erricka Bridgeford, who is director of training at the Baltimore Community Mediation Center, a nonprofit group that helps settle personal and neighborhood conflicts",,
7096, Bridgeford encouraged Guy to take her training course,,
7096, Guy started volunteering as a mediator and was soon offered the job of leading the center,,
7096," She took it, along with a two-thirds salary cut",,
7096,"Across Baltimore, there was by then a mounting sense that whatever path there was to be found out of the cityâ€™s chaos, its residents were going to have to find it themselves â€” that the authorities were no longer up to the task",,
7096," The lawlessness that followed the police pullback had persisted, and the city ended 2015 with 342 homicides, a 62 percent increase over the year before, within a dozen deaths of the worst year of the 1990s",,
7096, Ninety-three percent of the victims were black,,
7096," The rate at which detectives were able to close homicide cases fell from 50 percent in 2013 to 30 percent, as residents grew even warier of calling in tips or testifying",,
7096,"In July 2016, Mosbyâ€™s office dropped all remaining charges against officers in the Gray case, after trials resulted in three acquittals and one hung jury",,
7096," It was that August that the Department of Justice released its 163-page report on the Police Department, a result of a yearlong investigation it opened at the request of Rawlings-Blake after Grayâ€™s death",,
7096, The report concluded that the police had engaged in â€œa pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution or federal law,,
7096,â€ù The policeâ€™s pedestrian stops were disproportionately focused on African-Americans,,
7096, They frequently patted down or frisked people â€œwithout identifying necessary grounds to believe that the person is armed and dangerous,,
7096,"â€ù Baltimore officers used â€œoverly aggressive tactics that unnecessarily escalate encounters, increase tensions and lead to unnecessary force,â€ù the report stated",,
7096,The report affirmed yearsâ€™ worth of civilian complaints about the department,,
7096, But it also essentially ignored Barksdale and Bealefeldâ€™s largely successful efforts to move toward a more targeted policing approach,,
7096," It suggested that mass arrests led inexorably to Grayâ€™s death and the protests, when in fact by 2014, arrests had been halved from a decade earlier",,
7096," Barksdale was especially livid about the reportâ€™s suggestion that the department, which is roughly 40 percent black, was prejudiced because it arrested mostly African-Americans in many parts of town",,
7096, â€œNow a cop in a black community is wrong because he confronts black people?â€ù he told me,,
7096,"He was also confounded by the reportâ€™s mockery of the departmentâ€™s crackdowns on dice games, a frequent target of robberies and shootings",,
7096," â€œDude, you canâ€™t have [expletive] open-air dice games,â€ù he said",,
7096," Armed robbers â€œwant to stick that up, and if they have a shotgun and buckshot, youâ€™ll have six or seven victims",,
7096,"â€ù The failure of the reportâ€™s authors to grasp this, he said, betrayed a fundamental ignorance of local realities",,
7096," â€œThey have no understanding of what these things mean in Baltimore,â€ù he said",,
7096,"By that point, Baltimore had elected yet another new mayor: Catherine Pugh, who won the Democratic primary that April â€” in Baltimore, the only election that matters â€” after Rawlings-Blake opted not to run for re-election",,
7096," That December, Pugh came to her first meeting of CitiStat, the municipal accountability body started by Oâ€™Malley",,
7096," The meetings were held on the sixth floor of City Hall, where top city officials sat around a curved table and put questions to whichever agency head had been called to the lectern that day to defend his or her agencyâ€™s performance",,
7096,Very few people knew what to expect from Pugh,,
7096," A longtime state legislator, she had won mostly by virtue of not being Sheila Dixon, who, having served her community-service sentence, ran again for her old job and narrowly lost",,
7096," Pughâ€™s inscrutability extended to her bearing â€” she spoke in muffled tones, and her bangs often hung so low as to almost cover her eyes",,
7096,"At the CitiStat meeting, a major topic of discussion was a rise in carjackings",,
7096," Earlier that month, an 80-year-old member of the City Council was attacked by two teenage boys while getting into her car in a parking garage, leaving her with a black eye",,
7096," Davis, the commissioner, and his deputy said that the carjackings appeared to be the work of violent drug crews, who were deploying teenagers to steal cars as an initiation of sorts, and then often using the cars while committing homicides",,
7096,Pugh grew agitated,,
7096," The carjackings werenâ€™t a law-enforcement problem, she said; they were a problem of footloose youth",,
7096, Why wasnâ€™t the meeting instead focusing on how to get teenagers into jobs or after-school programs? She declared the meeting a waste of her time and left,,
7096, It was the last CitiStat meeting she would attend for at least six months,,
7096,Pugh seemed overwhelmed by the continuing violence,,
7096, It was not until August 2017 that she announced her plan to counter it,,
7096," It would be built around daily meetings to focus city services in high-crime areas â€” which she dubbed the Violence Reduction Initiative â€” as well as the addition of a Boston-based program for at-risk young people called Roca, and the expansion of Safe Streets, which deploys ex-offenders as â€œviolence interrupters",,
7096,â€ùAt the core of Pughâ€™s plan was the notion that crime was driven by root causes,,
7096," This was true, but it risked overlooking the most immediate dilemma: People inclined toward lawbreaking increasingly thought they could do so with impunity",,
7096," Delivery of basic services to address root-cause problems was also undermined by the departure of key city officials, as word spread that Pugh was not easy to work for",,
7096,"By this point, it was plain that the surge in violence was not simply going to abate",,
7096, Robberies and burglaries had also risen sharply,,
7096," The cityâ€™s population was falling again, nearing a 100-year low with less than 615,000 in a census estimate released in March 2017",,
7096," There were other, more ambient signs of disorder: the dirt bikes, squeegee boys at intersections",,
7096, The cityâ€™s bike-sharing program was so plagued with vandalism that it was eventually shut down,,
7096,"That summer, Erricka Bridgeford, Shantay Guyâ€™s friend at the mediation center, started Baltimore Ceasefire, an effort to get the cityâ€™s criminal element to put down their weapons for one weekend every three months",,
7096, The groupâ€™s main slogan was straightforward: â€œNobody Kill Anybody,,
7096,â€ù A second slogan was aimed at those inclined not toward violence but toward apathy: â€œDonâ€™t Be Numb,,
7096,"â€ù During the first cease-fire, that August, two men were killed",,
7096, Bridgeford went to the scenes to mourn the victims,,
7096,"The Justice Departmentâ€™s report, meanwhile, had led to the federal â€œconsent decreeâ€ù that the city negotiated with the department â€” a sweeping set of reforms of the Police Department that set out new rules governing stops and searches, internal discipline and much more",,
7096," Gene Ryan, the leader of the police union, complained that his organization had been shut out of the process of drafting it",,
7096," Tony Barksdale, who had been retired for three years and now spent his days trading stocks online, attacked it incessantly on Twitter, accusing city leaders of â€œhandcuffing your own cops while turning the city over to criminals",,
7096,"â€ùOne afternoon not long after Guy began her job as the consent-decree monitoring teamâ€™s community liaison, she strapped on a bulletproof vest and rode along with a city police officer to see the realities he and his colleagues faced",,
7096, The officer started his shift at 9 a,,
7096,m,,
7096," and, because of the departmentâ€™s shortage of officers, would work until 2:30 the next morning",,
7096,They cruised block after block of rowhouses in an especially drug-plagued area,,
7096, The officer received a text message to disperse a cluster of young men â€” a frequent point of confrontation in the city,,
7096," Young men often congregate in front of corner stores or liquor stores, sometimes just hanging out, other times selling drugs; the city would have a record 692 fatal opioid overdoses in 2017",,
7096,"â€œIâ€™m supposed to clear this corner,â€ù the officer told Guy, showing her the address on the screen",,
7096,â€œCan you do that?â€ù she asked,,
7096,"â€œNo,â€ù he said",,
7096," As he understood it, the consent decree barred him from dispersing the young men",,
7096, So he didnâ€™t,,
7096, But then his phone rang,,
7096," â€œI guess when I ignore a call, then I get a phone call telling me I need to do my [expletive] job,â€ù he said",,
7096, Which was indeed what the call was,,
7096,"He and Guy drove to the address, where half a dozen young men in their late teens or early 20s were standing outside",,
7096, The officer got out of the car and told them to move along,,
7096," â€œThe kids are angry,â€ù Guy recalled; they had already been booted from a nearby corner that afternoon",,
7096," â€œLike, â€˜What the [expletive], weâ€™re just standing here",,
7096," Weâ€™re not doing anything, whatâ€™s going on?â€™â€‰â€ùFor Guy, the moment affirmed her belief in the consent decree",,
7096, This sort of rote policing seemed pointless; nothing was accomplished by confronting the young men beyond fomenting ill will,,
7096, â€œThe question for me becomes: Whatâ€™s the intention for clearing the corners?â€ù she told me,,
7096, â€œAre you clearing the corners in white neighborhoods? The corners would not be so crowded if we actually became responsive to community needs,,
7096,"â€ù This was, in essence, Pughâ€™s strategy â€” if only it could be made to work",,
7096,On Nov,,
7096," 15, 2017, a veteran detective, Sean Suiter, drove with a partner to a blighted corner of West Baltimore to investigate a recent homicide",,
7096, Suiter told his partner he had seen someone suspicious in a vacant lot and went to investigate,,
7096, Shots rang out,,
7096," His partner found Suiter bleeding from the head, his gun lying under his body",,
7096, The 43-year-old father of five died the next day,,
7096," His death was ruled a homicide, the 309th of the year",,
7096,The police locked down six square blocks around the scene for six days,,
7096," Davis, the commissioner, pleaded with the community to offer tips to identify the â€œheartless, ruthless, soulless killer",,
7096,"â€ù The death felt like the cityâ€™s reaching its nadir, in more ways than one",,
7096," As the public learned in the week that followed, Suiter was scheduled to testify the next day before a grand jury in a vast corruption case that federal prosecutors filed earlier in the year: a conspiracy that painted a picture of a Police Department that, amid the lawlessness of the city, had descended into widespread lawlessness itself",,
7096,"The accused were eight current and former members of an elite plainclothes unit called the Gun Trace Task Force, which, prosecutors said, had developed a penchant for robbing people, mostly but not exclusively drug dealers",,
7096, Six of the officers pleaded guilty to racketeering and robbery,,
7096,"The trial of the remaining two, when it started in January 2018, offered daily revelations of brazen amorality",,
7096," There was the video shot by the unit to document â€œdiscoveringâ€ù $100,000 in a drug dealerâ€™s safe from which they had removed nearly twice that amount to divvy up",,
7096," There was the bail bondsman describing how, over the course of many months, he sold $1 million in drugs funneled to him by Sgt",,
7096," Wayne Jenkins, the groupâ€™s ringleader, including bags of pills looted from pharmacies during the April 2015 riots",,
7096,"There was the wiretap of officersâ€™ conspiring to lie to avoid detection for causing an accident during an improper high-speed chase, while doing nothing to help the victim lying in pain across the street",,
7096," And there was the extremity of their fraudulent overtime, many tens of thousands of dollars for each â€” they were being paid while at the beach, while spending weeks doing exurban home renovations â€” all of it draining the treasury of a city where, as the trial was taking place, thousands of children were shivering in unheated classrooms",,
7096,"The trial was an indictment of the string of police chiefs who had, despite some headline-making arrests of corrupt officers, presided over the decay of measures Oâ€™Malley pushed for as mayor, like reducing internal-affairs trial backlogs and expanding integrity stings",,
7096, The court proceedings also illuminated how the surge in violence after Grayâ€™s death abetted the corruption,,
7096," Some officers had been lining their pockets for years, but their activities became a true conspiracy amid the chaos of 2015-16, as commanders were so desperate to stem the violence that they gave them free rein",,
7096,"After the trial concluded, a dozen officers gathered at headquarters for a focus group, convened by the department to solicit their input on new policies stemming from the consent decree, on which they were to start receiving training in 2019",,
7096," But the officers had no interest in talking about the decree, according to one participant",,
7096," Instead, they vented about the impossibility of doing their job in a department in meltdown",,
7096," They were bitter about being constantly â€œdraftedâ€ù into mandatory overtime â€” departures and anemic recruiting had left the department with only 2,500 sworn officers, down 500 from five years earlier",,
7096,"A change in how the department scheduled shifts â€” made during Battsâ€™s tenure at the urging of the police union despite the warnings of Barksdale and Bealefeld â€” had helped cause the city to pay $47 million in overtime in 2017, three times overbudget; some days, 40 percent of patrol shifts were being staffed with mandatory overtime, wearing down officers",,
7096, The officers were also angry about the lack of resources and equipment,,
7096, They fumed over the conflicting orders they received,,
7096," â€œItâ€™s: â€˜Go out and stop crime, but donâ€™t hurt anyoneâ€™s feelings,â€™â€‰â€ù the veteran officer told me",,
7096, â€œâ€‰â€˜Be aggressive â€” but not too aggressive,,
7096,"â€™â€‰â€ùIn January 2018, Pugh replaced Kevin Davis with a new commissioner, Darryl De Sousa, but De Sousa resigned five months later after federal prosecutors charged him with failing to file tax returns for three recent years",,
7096," The interim commissioner, Gary Tuggle, had barely stepped into the revolving door of leadership when he found himself facing fresh crises: an officer who quit after being caught on video pummeling a man on the sidewalk, another found passed out drunk in his patrol car, a top commander who quit after throwing a chair against a wall during an argument at Police Headquarters",,
7096,"And then there was the stunning conclusion of the independent review panel investigating the death of Detective Suiter: He had most likely committed suicide in the vacant lot and made it look like a cop-killing, the panel ruled in August",,
7096, The investigators believed his suicide was possibly due to his ties to the corruption case,,
7096,"On a hot day in mid-August, several dozen city officials, police officers and commanders gathered at a bedraggled shopping plaza in the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore for one of the regular neighborhood walks that Mayor Pugh was conducting in her effort to exude a sense of authority",,
7096," The mass of suits and uniforms did a slow circuit of a few blocks of rowhouses, trailing behind Pugh",,
7096," â€œWatch your step,â€ù someone called out as the group neared a dead rat",,
7096,"A neighborhood leader pointed out problem spots: a dark block where prostitutes congregated, a bus stop in front of a liquor store that allowed loiterers to claim they were waiting for the bus, piles of trash",,
7096," It was far from the cityâ€™s roughest neighborhood, but Pugh was visibly taken aback by the disorder on display",,
7096, She expressed particular displeasure over the trash bags that had been piled into containers in advance of pickup day,,
7096," â€œYou donâ€™t see trash out front in Ashburton,â€ù the middle-class black enclave where she lived, she said under her breath",,
7096,"Two weeks later, I met Pugh in her office in City Hall",,
7096," The month was on its way to ending with 30 homicides, almost one per day",,
7096," But when I started to ask her about the surge in violence since 2015, she cut me off",,
7096," â€œIf you follow the trends lately, since November of last year weâ€™re trending downward,â€ù she said",,
7096,"â€œTheyâ€™ve trended down only so much,â€ù I protested",,
7096,"Pugh looked down at an iPad, swiping through crime-data summaries",,
7096," â€œMay, we had almost a 30 percent reduction in violence",,
7096," In October of last year, when I created the Violence Reduction Initiative, the following month, November, we dropped by almost 18 percent",,
7096," We dropped again in December, in January, in February",,
7096,"â€ùâ€œYear to date right now,â€ù I replied, â€œweâ€™re barely below where we were last year, and last year was our worst year ever",,
7096,"â€ùâ€œNo,â€ù she said",,
7096,"â€œWe just had more than one a day this past month,â€ù I said",,
7096,"â€œThis has been one of the worst months, but weâ€™re about 20 percent down in homicides this year thus far,â€ù she said",,
7096, â€œThatâ€™s tremendous in comparison with last year,,
7096,"â€ùâ€œWeâ€™re very likely to end up at 300 again this year,â€ù I said",,
7096,"â€œWeâ€™re very unlikely to get to 300 this year,â€ù she said",,
7096,There were 17 homicides in a single week in late September,,
7096, The year would end with 309 homicides â€” the fourth straight year above 300,,
7096," It was the early 1990s all over again â€” or even worse, considering that the city was now registering comparable numbers despite having 100,000 fewer people living in it",,
7096,"In mid-November, Pugh announced her choice for the next commissioner: Joel Fitzgerald, the police chief in Fort Worth, Tex",,
7096, But reporters at The Sun discovered overstatements in his rÃ©sumÃ©; the City Council expressed doubts about confirming him; and he himself seemed ambivalent,,
7096," Finally, after Christmas, with the city in its eighth month without a permanent commissioner, Pugh told reporters that she was considering bringing back Tony Barksdale, as head of the Mayorâ€™s Office of Criminal Justice",,
7096,"It was an intriguing development, given how outspoken Barksdale had been in his criticisms of current department leadership and of the consent decree to which the city had committed itself",,
7096," When I met with him a second time a couple of months earlier, in October, he told me he did not doubt the need for reform; he was mortified that some of the corrupt officers had come from the plainclothes teams he created",,
7096, But he was worried that things had gone too far,,
7096," â€œThe criminals are so emboldened now,â€ù he said",,
7096,"The decreeâ€™s demands had made it too difficult for officers to clear drug corners, he said",,
7096," He was hearing from his former colleagues that loiterers were already reciting the limits it imposed on the officers to them on patrol, mockingly",,
7096, (I had heard similar reports from a community activist who favored the decree,,
7096,") Its broadened definition of â€œuse of forceâ€ù â€” physical actions that officers had to document in reports, which went on their records and would be scrutinized â€” made officers less likely to bother engaging physically",,
7096,â€œWhat do you think happens when these guys see the cops not getting out of their car?â€ù Barksdale said,,
7096," â€œYears ago, if I pulled up and said â€˜Letâ€™s move,â€™ they moved",,
7096, Now who has the control? They have control,,
7096,â€ù Citizens lose trust in the police not only if they abuse their authority but also if they do nothing about people wreaking havoc on their community,,
7096," â€œLook at the number of bodies,â€ù he said",,
7096, â€œWeâ€™re losing horribly in Baltimore City,,
7096,â€ùIt was two days later that Daâ€™mon Guy Jr,,
7096,", Shantay Guyâ€™s stepson, got off the bus in the northwestern part of the city",,
7096," As he began his walk toward home, a purple Volvo S",,
7096,U,,
7096,V,,
7096, pulled up with four or five people inside,,
7096, He heard the locks click open,,
7096," As he ran, he heard a shout, then a gunshot",,
7096," It didnâ€™t register that he was hit in the lower back, he said later, until he realized that he couldnâ€™t get up",,
7096, He called his own ambulance,,
7096,Mayor Pugh visited him in the hospital several times,,
7096," She was in the room when Daâ€™mon, unable to speak because he was intubated, texted his stepmother: â€œAm I going to die tomorrow? Do my legs work?â€ùA couple of days later, he went into cardiac arrest",,
7096, Doctors and nurses rushed in,,
7096, Daâ€™mon Sr,,
7096," was in the hallway, out of his mind with panic, shaking and screaming",,
7096, â€œHe was just O,,
7096,K,,
7096,! I was just with him! He was just O,,
7096,K,,
7096,!â€ù People were trying to restrain him,,
7096, â€œJust let me see him!â€ù he screamed,,
7096,"As the blip of Daâ€™monâ€™s heartbeat returned on the monitor, Guy tried to calm her husband: â€œCan you hear it?â€ù she said",,
7096, â€œJust focus on the sound,,
7096,"â€ùAs Guy recounted the story in the cafe, I asked what she thought had driven the surge in violence",,
7096," It was the perception, she said, that â€œpolice officers are not doing their jobs, and folks out there doing dirt see that theyâ€™re not doing their jobs and whatever theyâ€™re doing they can get away with",,
7096,"â€ùThis was not so different from what I heard from Barksdale (who would learn in early March that he wasnâ€™t getting the City Hall job), but she insisted the answer was not a return to tougher tactics",,
7096," â€œTony and I arenâ€™t going to agree,â€ù she told me",,
7096," â€œIâ€™m always going to be looking at whatâ€™s throwing the children in the street: Whatâ€™s happening upstream to get them there?â€ù That applied even to the person who shot her stepson, she said",,
7096, â€œWhat happened to him or her that made this O,,
7096,K,,
7096, for them?â€ù she said,,
7096," â€œI believe theyâ€™re victims, too",,
7096, I really do,,
7096,"â€ùGuy had recently left her role with the consent-decree team to take a job at a civic-leadership organization, but she was still involved in police reform",,
7096," She would be leading meetings around town in which yet another new commissioner would be introduced to residents: Michael Harrison, late of New Orleans",,
7096, Pugh had settled on him after the Fort Worth chief pulled out in January,,
7096," Harrison seemed a good fit, someone who knew what it was like to police a violent city",,
7096," And he came from a department that had been in deep turmoil, after Hurricane Katrina, and was now operating under its own consent decree",,
7096,"On nine occasions, Guy stood alongside Harrison as he listened to the crowd turning out to see him",,
7096," A vast majority of questions were from residents, most of them African-American, asking for the department to provide their neighborhoods with more officers and a more energetic response to crowded corners and other signs of disorder",,
7096,"One of the meetings was in a school auditorium in Edmondson Village, a section of southwest Baltimore that has been especially hard hit by the surge in violence",,
7096," Last summer, just a few blocks from the school, a 7-year-old girl was fatally shot in a car off Edmondson Avenue, the thoroughfare that the transit rail line that Hogan canceled would have run along",,
7096, A police officer had been sitting in his cruiser a block away with the windows up; residents rushed to alert him,,
7096,The meeting was standing room only,,
7096," â€œWe just want to feel safe, period,â€ù Monique Washington, president of the Edmondson Village Community Association, told Harrison",,
7096," â€œOur people are in fear, and weâ€™re tired",,
7096,"â€ùAn hour into the forum, a neighborhood resident named Renee McCray stepped up to the microphone",,
7096," She described how bewildering it had been to accompany a friend downtown, near the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor, one night a few months earlier",,
7096, â€œThe lighting was so bright,,
7096, People had scooters,,
7096, They had bikes,,
7096, They had babies in strollers,,
7096, And I said: â€˜What city is this? This is not Baltimore City,,
7096,"â€™ Because if you go up to Martin Luther King Boulevardâ€ù â€” the demarcation between downtown and the west side â€” â€œweâ€™re all bolted in our homes, weâ€™re locked down",,
7096,â€ù She paused for a moment to deliver her point,,
7096," â€œAll any of us want is equal protection,â€ù she said",,
7096,It was a striking echo of the language in the Department of Justice report and the activistsâ€™ condemnations of the police following Grayâ€™s death,,
7096," Back then, the claims were of overly aggressive policing; now residents were pleading for police officers to get out of their cars, to earn their pay â€” to protect them",,
7096,"You could look at this evolution as demonstrating an irreconcilable conflict, a tension between Shantay Guy and Tony Barksdale never to be resolved",,
7096, But the residents streaming into these sessions with Harrison werenâ€™t suggesting that,,
7096, They were not describing a trade-off between justice and order,,
7096, They saw them as two parts of a whole and were daring to ask for both,,
7097,"During the 10-day run of the Sundance Film Festival each January, the otherwise-unassuming ski hamlet of Park City, Utah, begins to look like the Hamptons on Fourth of July weekend",,
7097," Traffic inches anxiously along the snow-carpeted Main Street, littered with the accidents of those unused to driving on snow or unused to driving at all",,
7097," Angelenos and New Yorkers line the sidewalks in the gathering darkness, presenting their bona fides or tall tales to the nearest bouncer, straining their necks to find old friends â€” or new connections who might see in them what they see in themselves",,
7097," They are easily distinguishable from the locals by their attire, everything from freshly purchased skiwear to full-length furs to homemade-looking get-ups sparkling with the jewels of American self-invention",,
7097,"At the end of a grueling day and a half trying to sell his slate of new projects, Charles D",,
7097, King â€” the 48-year-old founder of a two-year-old media start-up called Macro â€” piled with his associates into the back of a black S,,
7097,U,,
7097,V,,
7097, to make his way to the house that was serving as their festival hub,,
7097," Until recently, King was one of Hollywoodâ€™s top agents, the only African-American to make partner at William Morris Endeavor in the firmâ€™s long history",,
7097," (If youâ€™ve turned on a television, watched a movie or listened to popular music in the past decade, youâ€™ve almost surely witnessed the other side of a deal King brokered",,
7097,") As difficult as any midcareer job change can be, Kingâ€™s was an even rarer thing: Starting Macro meant stepping down from a rarefied perch heâ€™d spent his entire professional life fighting to reach",,
7097, The uncertainty of starting a new business was only compounded by the audacity of Kingâ€™s vision,,
7097," He announced Macro not simply as a production house but as an entire media company, one whose content would reflect the new demographics of America â€” solving a problem the media industry only fitfully, grudgingly acknowledges is even real",,
7097,"Kingâ€™s rented bungalow sat at the top of a residential street on a small foothill, but with a blizzard still pummeling the town, the Uber driver found his S",,
7097,U,,
7097,V,,
7097, sliding down the icy grade,,
7097, Backing up and gunning uphill again only sent the car spinning sideways,,
7097," After one last halfhearted, face-saving attempt, King and an entourage that included his wife, Stacey Walker King, nodded sympathetically before bundling into their parkas to walk the rest of the way",,
7097," On the trudge uphill, everyone lashed by the wind and complaining of hunger, King alone seemed enraptured by the falling snow and went loping energetically up the slope, pulling the rest of the party along with his enthusiasm",,
7097,"Macro has made waves with some early projects, like Denzel Washingtonâ€™s Oscar-nominated film adaptation of August Wilsonâ€™s â€œFences,â€ù but itâ€™s still a new venture, and it has a start-upâ€™s shoot-the-moon sense of urgency and excitement",,
7097," Inside the house, a boisterous late-night crew â€” including several Macro executives and part of the youthful cast and crew of â€œGente-fied,â€ù a digital project about generational and class tension in the Los Angeles Mexican-American community â€” was already joking, decompressing and discussing the dayâ€™s films, panels and deal-making",,
7097," King had brought several titles to the festival, each of them carefully positioned and, so far, enthusiastically received",,
7097," One of them had become a darling of the festival: Dee Reesâ€™s â€œMudbound,â€ù a World War II drama about two families from opposite sides of the race line",,
7097," Still, at 10 p",,
7097,m,,
7097,", as he sat down to eat, King didnâ€™t have distribution in place for any of his projects",,
7097," Before starting on the turkey sandwich heâ€™d made himself, he placed two cellphones on the table, next to a glass of sweet tea",,
7097," â€œItâ€™s an old agentâ€™s trick,â€ù he explained",,
7097," â€œYou always carry two phones, in case one dies or loses reception",,
7097,"â€ùIn his past life as an agent, King carried no real financial risk: Agents are paid a percentage of the deals they negotiate",,
7097," As the founder of a media company, each deal he strikes has a material impact not only on his own fate but also on those of his employees and investors",,
7097," Perhaps the most formidable obstacle to Macroâ€™s success is a body of received wisdom about why the world on our screens looks so different from the real world it ostensibly mirrors â€” ideas about how films starring black actors donâ€™t do as well in crucial overseas markets, or that Hollywood has no bias against women, or that Asian men canâ€™t be leading men",,
7097," There are countless claims like these, almost all of them unsubstantiated, tautological or otherwise self-serving",,
7097," Kingâ€™s project is to break down these barriers, and he exudes a quiet confidence in his vision: that there is vast cultural and economic opportunity in telling meaningful stories to diverse audiences",,
7097, He describes this effort as â€œa front in the civil rights battle,,
7097,"â€ù Past generations marched for things the law could do, like dismantling housing segregation or securing voting rights",,
7097, King wants to accomplish something the law cannot: using film to fill in the subtle degrees of experience that reveal our lives to one another,,
7097," When people look at all the ubiquitous screens that surround us, King wants us to see ourselves",,
7097," Not only African-Americans, but everyone",,
7097,"In Kingâ€™s own career, breaking down barriers has meant keeping cool and taking his lumps â€” some of them simply for being an outsider â€” as he studied the business and fought his way up from a subminimum-wage position in the William Morris mailroom",,
7097, Macro is the culmination of his lifeâ€™s work and the realization of dreams he has nursed since he was just another scrawny kid in Georgia,,
7097," If the projects the company champions do well, then King, and everything he serves, will do well, too",,
7097," If not, he will have made a life-defining miscalculation",,
7097," So as the rest of Park City partied or slept, King swiveled back and forth between his sandwich and his phones",,
7097," His face, which has a boyish enthusiasm when heâ€™s excited, turns profoundly focused when he considers the business aspect of things; in unguarded moments he sometimes looks as beatific as a Dostoyevsky character",,
7097," You get the sense of a man whose neural network is wired differently â€” so much so that I felt compelled to ask his wife, Stacey, about these reveries when I ran into her in the Salt Lake City airport",,
7097," â€œOh, you saw that?â€ù she asked",,
7097, â€œCharles daydreams,,
7097, He stares into space,,
7097, I didnâ€™t understand at first,,
7097, Now I get it,,
7097," Heâ€™s processing, making connections",,
7097, Thereâ€™s a real vision there,,
7097,"â€ùAside from jazz, with its blending of European and African musical sensibilities, film might be the most American of all art forms",,
7097," Certainly few forms have been as integral in shaping how we Americans see ourselves, and how the world sees us",,
7097," But in filmâ€™s very beginnings, approximately 120 years ago, African-Americansâ€™ role in the new medium was merely a collection of stereotypes borrowed from vaudeville",,
7097, Thomas Edisonâ€™s own peep-show company featured such cultural uplift as â€œThe Pickaninnies Doing a Dance,,
7097,"â€ù Ever since, African-American actors, writers and directors have struggled to create roles in mainstream cinema that depicted the full range of black humanity and to finance and distribute films of their own making",,
7097,"Both efforts have been slow but steady going, marked by sporadic success and cyclical setbacks",,
7097," In the early 20th century, they were led by figures like Oscar Micheaux, a writer and producer of all-black â€œrace films",,
7097,"â€ù In the middle of the century, figures like Dorothy Dandridge, Sidney Poitier and Sammy Davis Jr",,
7097, challenged filmic segregation,,
7097," The â€™70s saw the birth of blaxploitation (Richard Roundtree, Pam Grier), diverse independent efforts (Melvin Van Peebles, Gordon Parks) and huge comedic presences (Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor)",,
7097," By the turn of the 21st century, a new wave of filmmaking had fought its way to true crossover stardom, with directors like Spike Lee, Julie Dash and John Singleton and a generation of actors including Forest Whitaker, Dave Chappelle and Halle Berry",,
7097," More recently, the success of films like â€œGet Out,â€ù â€œMoonlightâ€ù and â€œI Am Not Your Negroâ€ù has made it easy to forget that, only a year ago, Hollywood faced the uncomfortable truth that not a single black actor had been nominated for an Academy Award",,
7097,"Yet each of those recent success stories was an independent production, with origins outside the clubby confines of Hollywood studios",,
7097," Making film and television is an expensive gamble, and when the people making the wagers all come from a single demographic, the only certainty is that their own point of view will always be well represented",,
7097," â€œIt think itâ€™s pretty simple,â€ù says the ICM agent Andrea Nelson Meigs, whose clients include BeyoncÃ© and QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis",,
7097, â€œPeople buy what they relate to,,
7097, People buy what theyâ€™re familiar with,,
7097," If the person behind the desk doesnâ€™t relate to the experience of the person in front of it, itâ€™s 50-50",,
7097,"â€ù She illustrated this with a story from her own office, where she was surprised to learn that of several young assistants, only one, an African-American woman, was aware of the iconic activist Angela Davis, the subject of a potential biopic",,
7097," â€œIf thatâ€™s the room weâ€™re pitching,â€ù Nelson Meigs says, â€œthat story doesnâ€™t get made",,
7097,"â€ùIt doesnâ€™t help that Hollywood relies on tweaking proven formulas, meaning any filmmaker without successful antecedents they can use to back up their ideas will face high hurdles",,
7097," The one area where African-Americans have found relatively consistent recent success in the industry has been the popular work of directors like Lee Daniels, F",,
7097," Gary Gray or Tyler Perry, to which audiences flock for the same reason whole neighborhoods once gathered around the television: because they will see themselves on the screen, and because they know they will not feel insulted by what they see",,
7097," It has not been easy to secure even that much, let alone opportunities to make more psychologically and artistically ambitious films",,
7097," â€œWhen I started it was the age of Spike Lee,â€ù says Poppy Hanks, Macroâ€™s senior vice president for production, who attended the University of Southern California at the same time as John Singleton, and whose early career coincided with the commercial success of movies like â€œSoul Foodâ€ù (which she worked on) and â€œWaiting to Exhale",,
7097,â€ù â€œThere was just a wave that gave us a sense it was all possible,,
7097,"â€ù As she made her way into the business, though, she saw how difficult it could be to push such films through the industry",,
7097," â€œItâ€™s always shocking to them when something succeeds,â€ù she says",,
7097," â€œNot to us, but to them",,
7097,â€ùKingâ€™s career has spanned both reliable franchises like the â€œBarbershopâ€ù movies and more ambitious films like â€œFruitvale Station,,
7097,"â€ù He understands what pleases crowds, but he also understands the narrowness of current cinema and the pent-up creative energies outside it",,
7097," â€œThe specific message I want to resonate,â€ù he says, â€œis people of color have stories to tell",,
7097,"â€ù Part of this conviction comes from his youth, when he watched his mother try to publish the novel she worked on every day after coming home, only to be met with rejection by industry gatekeepers",,
7097," â€œI remember the impact that had on her,â€ù he says",,
7097," â€œIt made her question whether she was a gifted writer, and she was",,
7097,"â€ù He does not say it, but it is clear in his tone that he still thinks the rejections had less to do with merit than with other forces",,
7097," The business of culture is one of the most subjective in American society, and its executive suites are all filled with unintentional, unexamined biases",,
7097," Added together, those biases can still accomplish nearly the same ends as the outright aggression directed at people of color a century ago",,
7097, There was no animus toward Kingâ€™s mother,,
7097," They simply couldnâ€™t see her, or her story",,
7097,"Charles David King was born in Harlem in 1969, when his father was a pediatrics resident at Harlem Hospital",,
7097," After stints in North Carolina and Atlanta, the family settled in suburban Decatur, Ga",,
7097,", among the first African-Americans in an area that soon fell into a pattern of white flight",,
7097," When I asked him, over lunch one afternoon, the first time he remembers being treated differently, he had to think only a moment before replying, â€œThird grade",,
7097,"â€ù His family had just arrived in Georgia, and when he started school, â€œit was the height of being bused",,
7097, They tried to put me on a lower learning track,,
7097,"â€ù To compensate, â€œI just did what we always do, you know",,
7097, Work twice as hard,,
7097,"â€ù As a young African-American male, however bourgeois, he remembers being accosted by the police in malls or on campus at Vanderbilt University, where he studied political science and communications",,
7097,"After Vanderbilt, King enrolled at the historically black Howard University for law school",,
7097," It was a summer internship at MTV that gave him his first real exposure to the media industry, and it was while living in 1990s New York that he met Stacey Walker, a 22-year-old recent Duke graduate",,
7097," She recalls their first meeting as anything but fateful: She was leaving a party with friends, and King and his friends were on their way in, an encounter he claimed not to remember when they ran into each other again shortly afterward",,
7097," Nonetheless, they were soon dating seriously",,
7097," He moved to Los Angeles a year later; after a year and half, Stacey joined him",,
7097, Theyâ€™ve been together some 20 years,,
7097,"Before heading West, at the suggestion of a mentor in New York, King wrote what he describes as â€œhundreds of Unabomber letters,â€ù which yielded dozens of informational interviews and, ultimately, four job offers, one of them a coveted spot in the William Morris mailroom",,
7097, He turned out to be the only African-American trainee in film and television,,
7097," The William Morris Agency was founded in 1898 as William Morris, Vaudeville Agent; itâ€™s so old that its original client list included Charlie Chaplin and Mae West",,
7097," Its mailroom is actually an extremely competitive internship program, offering trainees an opportunity to learn the business and prove themselves from the inside",,
7097," As with many such programs, privilege, connections and nepotism were often at least as important as ability",,
7097," â€œI donâ€™t think there had been an African-American trainee there in years,â€ù King says, shaking his head with grim bemusement",,
7097," To celebrate his new role, he invited Stacey to dinner at Spago, one of Hollywoodâ€™s old-school watering holes",,
7097," As they waited in line for their table, Stacey learned for the first time how much he was making",,
7097, She told him she didnâ€™t feel well,,
7097," â€œWe left,â€ù she says, smiling mischievously",,
7097, â€œWe never ate together at Spago Hollywood,,
7097,"â€ùâ€œWhile all the sons and daughters of studio heads were out with each other, I would stay behind and talk to Rick,â€ù King recalls â€” meaning Rick Palacio, the assistant supervisor of the mailroom",,
7097," Despite the meager pay, King saw the mailroom as â€œa gold mineâ€ù of information and possibility",,
7097," He was promoted to assistant on the desk of an agent, then quickly removed",,
7097," â€œI was not a great assistant,â€ù he admits",,
7097, â€œI was too focused on the big picture,,
7097, What I really needed to learn was that paying your dues was more than going through the motions,,
7097,"â€ù When he found himself with a second shot in the mailroom, he redoubled his efforts: â€œI was going to get fired or promoted",,
7097,â€ùHe credits the firmâ€™s African-American clients â€” and their managers and other assorted â€œpeopleâ€ù â€” with making sure it was the promotion,,
7097," He may have been a junior employee, but some bigger industry players gravitated toward him, in part because he understood their clientsâ€™ value in ways others in the agency did not",,
7097, He also had a talent for building community,,
7097," â€œBecause there are so few people of color, we all know each other,â€ù Hanks says",,
7097, â€œThere was an unspoken locking of the arms,,
7097, We were all kids figuring it out,,
7097," I donâ€™t even know if Charles knows this, but I know both my bosses were putting pressure on his bosses to promote him",,
7097,"â€ùEventually, King says, â€œthere was a groundswellâ€ù of people lobbying his cause",,
7097," In 2000, he escaped the mailroom for good",,
7097," Still, there were many within the office who â€œwere sniggering at the things I was suggesting,â€ù he remembers",,
7097," One such incident, which I first heard about from Mike Palank, his assistant at the time and now an executive at Macro, concerned a weekly meeting in which agents at William Morris speculated about how the firmâ€™s movie openings would do in each weekendâ€™s box office",,
7097," The week before one of Kingâ€™s projects opened, he attended expectantly, only to find his clientâ€™s movie wasnâ€™t even on the agenda",,
7097," He was vindicated by Monday morning, when the receipts were counted â€” and Tyler Perryâ€™s â€œDiary of a Mad Black Womanâ€ù turned out to have the highest gross in the country",,
7097,"By the time he was brokering Perryâ€™s first television deal, he had learned to use being underestimated to their advantage",,
7097," The two men were â€œshockedâ€ù by how small an audience the network thought Perryâ€™s â€œHouse of Payneâ€ù would attract, so they arranged a unique kind of deal: If the showâ€™s first 10 episodes, which Perry self-produced, reached their target numbers, the network would agree to order 90 more",,
7097," This was a pioneering example of what would become known in the industry as a â€œ10-90 deal,â€ù and it made Perry and King a great deal more powerful",,
7097," Soon King had built a staggering list of clients, including Oprah Winfrey, Tim Story (the highest-grossing black director in the industry), Missy Elliott, Andre Benjamin of Outkast, Prince, Janet Jackson and Terrence Howard",,
7097,Agents negotiate between talent and money,,
7097," They can connect, nurture and translate, but the ultimate decision-making power lies elsewhere",,
7097," With Macro, finally, the decisions are Kingâ€™s",,
7097," He has designed the company with great care: Macro is situated at the intersection of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, combining the core elements of a production company with an aggressive focus on digital platforms",,
7097," The companies King cites as similar to Macro include both content behemoths like Vice and nimble midsize production companies like Legendary, whose movies â€” including â€œInterstellarâ€ù and â€œKong: Skull Islandâ€ù â€” punch above their weight",,
7097," Shortly after I saw him at Sundance, â€œMudboundâ€ù won the largest distribution deal of any movie at the festival",,
7097, â€œGente-fiedâ€ù ignited a bidding war among six networks,,
7097, â€œFencesâ€ù won an Oscar for Viola Davis,,
7097," Maybe most remarkable, King closed a second round of funding â€” just announced in recent days â€” to the tune of $150 million",,
7097," â€œI think thereâ€™s an enormous hunger for these stories,â€ù says one lead investor, Laurene Powell Jobs, who has known King since they worked together on the board of a nonprofit",,
7097, â€œHeâ€™s at the forefront,,
7097, All of us who saw something special in Charles are just seeing what heâ€™s capable of,,
7097,â€ùStacey has known longer than most,,
7097," â€œCharles told me he was going to build a media company on our first date,â€ù she says",,
7097," â€œThings never look exactly as you imagine them, but itâ€™s what he always said he wanted to do",,
7097,"â€ù King plans to produce or co-produce between four and six films a year, with a maximum investment of $35 million, in addition to â€œat least three shows on streaming, or television and cable,â€ù an unspecified number of digital shows and a portfolio of investments in pure technology companies",,
7097," Projects in development include another project with Washington, as well as collaborations with Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, Van Jones, Eva Longoria and Justin Simien",,
7097," â€œCharles and I have been fighting this fight for 18 years,â€ù says Hanks, one of Macroâ€™s first hires",,
7097, â€œI know weâ€™ve done really well,,
7097, Now we have to keep it up,,
7097,â€ùAll of this almost didnâ€™t happen,,
7097," When King began trying to raise money for Macro, no one seemed to have much faith in his ability to start a company, and the early fund-raising effort proved to be as great a challenge as he had faced in his career",,
7097," â€œLetâ€™s just say weâ€™re extremely lucky for the investors we have,â€ù he says, maneuvering his black Tesla absent-mindedly through traffic on the way to his son Julianâ€™s basketball game",,
7097," King is modest in conversation, but he has a deep competitive drive, and his superhuman effectiveness actually had me wondering what he wasnâ€™t good at, right until I first got in his car and discovered what a terrifyingly bad driver he is",,
7097," When I mentioned this one morning at Macroâ€™s Hollywood office, the entire room burst into laughter",,
7097," â€œWere his hands even on the wheel?â€ù asked Aaliyah Williams, Macroâ€™s vice president for digital content and production",,
7097, â€œOr was he driving with his knee?â€ùThe offices are in a rapidly transforming corridor of Los Angeles,,
7097," The work of up-and-coming artists adorns the walls; the soundtrack is classic rap, and the work force looks as harmoniously multicultural and gender-balanced as America imagines itself",,
7097," These employees arenâ€™t just betting their fates on the movie business but on interlocking shifts in demographics, culture and technology",,
7097," Macro, King believes, is in the vanguard of a new cultural universe, one made possible by the shrinking space between technology and film",,
7097, â€œWeâ€™re building a global company for a new majority,,
7097, We wonâ€™t be the only one,,
7097,"â€ù He begins listing mighty firms that fell (MGM, Blockbuster, Time Warner), noting new entities that sprang up seemingly from nowhere (Netflix) and theorizing what the landscape may look like decades from now â€” before going abruptly silent, to keep from tipping too much of his own hand",,
7097," â€œWell, you can imagine,â€ù he concludes, cutting across several lanes of rush-hour traffic on the freeway after missing an exit",,
7097,"King is not the first to see the problem of diversity in popular culture; it has been apparent since the beginning, and like every struggle for equality in this post-civil rights country, in this post-colonial world, it has been a generation-over-generation battle",,
7097, His challenge to us â€” to imagine new cultural possibilities â€” also challenges the sense everyone in the old order has of being an expert about the culture,,
7097," What if the world we think we know is only a tiny, myopic fraction of it? What if the things we believe we understand are nothing but learned patterns? We imagine that wanting to be inclusive and cosmopolitan makes us so, but we continue to be produced by and inhabit the structures that create oppression",,
7097," This is precisely what makes it so important that Hollywood be truly democratic: It represents so much of the inner, the hidden and exceptional, of this country",,
7097," If there is no space for the visions of the most talented among us no matter where they come from â€” or how strange their ideas may seem to those who cannot comprehend them â€” what possible future can we really have but the most ordinary?As the sun set, King piloted his Tesla noiselessly down the 101, oblivious to the way he was disrupting traffic",,
7097," He finished his final call of the day in the last amber hour of light on this side of the Pacific, and I watched him stare intently into the distance behind his sunglasses in the silent interior of the car",,
7097," White-knuckling the corner of my seat, something Stacey said returned to me â€” his processing, his making connections",,
7097, I understood he was dreaming,,
7098,"When science fiction writers first imagined robot invasions, the idea was that bots would become smart and powerful enough to take over the world by force, whether on their own or as directed by some evildoer",,
7098," In reality, something only slightly less scary is happening",,
7098," Robots are getting better, every day, at impersonating humans",,
7098," When directed by opportunists, malefactors and sometimes even nation-states, they pose a particular threat to democratic societies, which are premised on being open to the people",,
7098,Robots posing as people have become a menace,,
7098," For popular Broadway shows (need we say â€œHamiltonâ€ù?), it is actually bots, not humans, who do much and maybe most of the ticket buying",,
7098," Shows sell out immediately, and the middlemen (quite literally, evil robot masters) reap millions in ill-gotten gains",,
7098,"Philip Howard, who runs the Computational Propaganda Research Project at Oxford, studied the deployment of propaganda bots during voting on Brexit, and the recent American and French presidential elections",,
7098," Twitter is particularly distorted by its millions of robot accounts; during the French election, it was principally Twitter robots who were trying to make #MacronLeaks into a scandal",,
7098, Facebook has admitted it was essentially hacked during the American election in November,,
7098," In Michigan, Mr",,
7098," Howard notes, â€œjunk news was shared just as widely as professional news in the days leading up to the election",,
7098,â€ùRobots are also being used to attack the democratic features of the administrative state,,
7098," This spring, the Federal Communications Commission put its proposed revocation of net neutrality up for public comment",,
7098, In previous years such proceedings attracted millions of (human) commentators,,
7098," This time, someone with an agenda but no actual public support unleashed robots who impersonated (via stolen identities) hundreds of thousands of people, flooding the system with fake comments against federal net neutrality rules",,
7098,"To be sure, todayâ€™s impersonation-bots are different from the robots imagined in science fiction: They arenâ€™t sentient, donâ€™t carry weapons and donâ€™t have physical bodies",,
7098," Instead, fake humans just have whatever is necessary to make them seem human enough to â€œpassâ€ù: a name, perhaps a virtual appearance, a credit-card number and, if necessary, a profession, birthday and home address",,
7098, They are brought to life by programs or scripts that give one person the power to imitate thousands,,
7098,"The problem is almost certain to get worse, spreading to even more areas of life as bots are trained to become better at mimicking humans",,
7098," Given the degree to which product reviews have been swamped by robots (which tend to hand out five stars with abandon), commercial sabotage in the form of negative bot reviews is not hard to predict",,
7098," In coming years, campaign finance limits will be (and maybe already are) evaded by robot armies posing as â€œsmallâ€ù donors",,
7098, And actual voting is another obvious target â€” perhaps the ultimate target,,
7098,"So far, weâ€™ve been content to leave the problem to the tech industry, where the focus has been on building defenses, usually in the form of Captchas (â€œcompletely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apartâ€ù), those annoying â€œtype thisâ€ù tests to prove you are not a robot",,
7098, But leaving it all to industry is not a long-term solution,,
7098," For one thing, the defenses donâ€™t actually deter impersonation bots, but perversely reward whoever can beat them",,
7098," And perhaps the greatest problem for a democracy is that companies like Facebook and Twitter lack a serious financial incentive to do anything about matters of public concern, like the millions of fake users who are corrupting the democratic process",,
7098," Twitter estimates at least 27 million probably fake accounts; researchers suggest the real number is closer to 48 million, yet the company does little about the problem",,
7098,"The problem is a public as well as private one, and impersonation robots should be considered what the law calls â€œhostis humani generisâ€ù: enemies of mankind, like pirates and other outlaws",,
7098, That would allow for a better offensive strategy: bringing the power of the state to bear on the people deploying the robot armies to attack commerce or democracy,,
7098,The ideal anti-robot campaign would employ a mixed technological and legal approach,,
7098," Improved robot detection might help us find the robot masters or potentially help national security unleash counterattacks, which can be necessary when attacks come from overseas",,
7098, There may be room for deputizing private parties to hunt down bad robots,,
7098, A simple legal remedy would be a â€œ Blade Runnerâ€ù law that makes it illegal to deploy any program that hides its real identity to pose as a human,,
7098," Automated processes should be required to state, â€œI am a robot",,
7098,"â€ù When dealing with a fake human, it would be nice to know",,
7098,"Using robots to fake support, steal tickets or crash democracy really is the kind of evil that science fiction writers were warning about",,
7098," The use of robots takes advantage of the fact that political campaigns, elections and even open markets make humanistic assumptions, trusting that there is wisdom or at least legitimacy in crowds and value in public debate",,
7098," But when support and opinion can be manufactured, bad or unpopular arguments can win not by logic but by a novel, dangerous form of force â€” the ultimate threat to every democracy",,

7099," MOVES TO RESTRICT FOREIGN DEALS INTENDED TO AVOID TAXES  |  The Treasury Department took additional steps on Monday to discourage American companies from making foreign acquisitions so that they can move overseas for a lower tax rate,  Leslie Picker and Michael J",,
7099, de la Merced report in DealBook,,
7099," The Treasury Department had issued rules in September 2014 and in November to restrict this type of acquisition, known as a corporate inversion, but the measures announced on Monday are aimed at what the government calls  Ã¢Â€Âœserial inverters,Ã¢Â€Âù or foreign companies that have bulked up through multiple deals with American companies in a short period",,
7099," The new rules  threaten PfizerÃ¢Â€Â™s proposed $150 billion takeover of Allergan, a drug maker based in Dublin",,
7099," Though the Pfizer-Allergan deal is not structured as an inversion (technically Allergan is the acquirer and Pfizer is the target), it still achieves the same goal of a lower tax rate abroad",,
7099,Current Treasury Department rules blocking inversions  donÃ¢Â€Â™t apply if the foreign buyerÃ¢Â€Â™s shareholders own more than 40 percent of the combined company,,
7099, Foreign companies have been able to meet the ownership requirements by increasing in size through multiple inversions or acquisitions of American companies,,
7099," However, the regulations on Monday would  essentially disregard the value of American businesses acquired over the last three years, making it more difficult for the foreign company to own more than 40 percent of the merged entity",,
7099,This throws into doubt the Pfizer-Allergan deal,,
7099," Under the new rules, Allergan may be considered a serial inverter because the Dublin-based Actavis acquired Allergan in 2015, taking the Irish domicile, and then turned around and signed a deal with Pfizer",,
7099,"  Shares in Allergan dropped 21 percent in after-hours trading on the heels of the Treasury announcement, and the companies said in a joint statement that they would review the new rules",,
7099,"The Treasury DepartmentÃ¢Â€Â™s new rules also try to erase another economic benefit of inversions, one that is known as  earnings stripping (which Steven Davidoff Solomon explained in detail in  his Deal Professor column in February)",,
7099," This tactic involves the American subsidiary borrowing from the parent company and using the interest payments on the loans to offset earnings, which lowers the tax bill",,
7099," The new rules classify this transaction as if it were stock-based instead of debt,  eliminating the interest deduction for the American subsidiary",,
7099, This change  applies not just to inversions but to any foreign company that has acquired an American entity and has used this technique to achieve lower taxes,,
7099,"VALUEACT IS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING ANTITRUST LAW  |  The Justice Department filed a $19 million antitrust lawsuit against ValueAct on Monday, accusing the hedge fund of failing to alert regulators after it bought about $2",,
7099,"5 billion worth of stock in both Baker Hughes and Halliburton after the two energy giants announced a merger,  Leslie Picker reports in DealBook",,
7099," The government said the hedge fund violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, whose purpose is to give regulators a chance to block any investment that might thwart competition, but ValueAct said in a statement that it had complied with the law",,
7099,"At issue is whether ValueAct was an active investor that wanted to influence business decisions of management teams, which would have required filing notifications with regulators, or a passive one and thus exempt from filing",,
7099," In an attempt to prove ValueActÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to influence the two companies, regulators pointed to  ValueActÃ¢Â€Â™s meeting with senior management at both companies more than 15 times from December 2014 to January 2016, according to the complaint",,
7099,Matt Levine of Bloomberg View  cast a skeptical eye  on the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s contention that these actions constituted investor activism,,
7099," Ã¢Â€ÂœSure, demanding board representation or mounting a proxy fight is something more than Ã¢Â€Â˜solely for the purposes of investment",,
7099,"Ã¢Â€Â™  But just talking to management and other shareholders isnÃ¢Â€Â™t,Ã¢Â€Âù he wrote",,
7099," Ã¢Â€ÂœIf you are a big investor, talking to management is just a basic part of your job, a necessary condition of any investment: It would be irresponsible to invest $2",,
7099,5 billion Ã¢Â€Â” especially in two companies with a merger pending Ã¢Â€Â” without talking to management and other shareholders,,
7099," If Ã¢Â€Â˜solely for the purposes of investmentÃ¢Â€Â™ forbids sharing ideas with management and other shareholders, or even supporting management in decisions that it has already made,  then almost no actual investments qualify",,

7100,Two executives described the development as part of an effort to rethink the way TV companies approach streaming video to make the experience easier for viewers,,
7100,"The new service would not look like a regular cable channel, instead offering a more intuitive, personalized experience, one person said",,

7100," An ad for cat food, for example, would be aimed at cat owners",,
7100,"Offering a combination of live and recorded programming to streaming services required changing traditional rights agreements, and the TV companies are expected to start making their programs available to other streaming services in a similar fashion, one executive said",,
7100,"Other such slimmed-down streaming television services include Sling TV, available for about $20 a month, and PlayStation Vue, which starts at about $40 a month",,
7100,The services are aimed at younger consumers who prefer a more tailored streaming experience over a traditional cable or satellite subscription package and customers known as â€œcord cuttersâ€ù who resist paying for bundles of hundreds of cable channels,,
7100,"Todd Juenger, an analyst with Sanford C",,
